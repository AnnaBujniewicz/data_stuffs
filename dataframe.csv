Li X., Wu P., Wang W.;Incorporating stock prices and news sentiments for stock market prediction: A case of Hong Kong;2020;Information Processing and Management;17;Stock prediction via market data analysis is an attractive research topic. Both stock prices and news articles have been employed in the prediction processes. However, how to combine technical indicators from stock prices and news sentiments from textual news articles, and make the prediction model be able to learn sequential information within time series in an intelligent way, is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we build up a stock prediction system and propose an approach that 1) represents numerical price data by technical indicators via technical analysis, and represents textual news articles by sentiment vectors via sentiment analysis, 2) setup a layered deep learning model to learn the sequential information within market snapshot series which is constructed by the technical indicators and news sentiments, 3) setup a fully connected neural network to make stock predictions. Experiments have been conducted on more than five years of Hong Kong Stock Exchange data using four different sentiment dictionaries, and results show that 1) the proposed approach outperforms the baselines in both validation and test sets using two different evaluation metrics, 2) models incorporating prices and news sentiments outperform models that only use either technical indicators or news sentiments, in both individual stock level and sector level, 3) among the four sentiment dictionaries, finance domain-specific sentiment dictionary (Loughran–McDonald Financial Dictionary) models the news sentiments better, which brings more prediction performance improvements than the other three dictionaries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;"Deep learning; News sentiment analysis; Stock prediction";"Aiolli, F., Donini, M., EasyMKL: A scalable multiple kernel learning algorithm (2015) Neurocomputing, 169, pp. 215-224; Akita, R., Yoshihara, A., Matsubara, T., Uehara, K., Deep learning for stock prediction using numerical and textual information (2016) 2016IEEE/ACIS 15th international conference on computer and information science, pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., Sentiwordnet 3.0: An enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2010) Lrec, 10, pp. 2200-2204; Baltas, N., Jessop, D., Jones, C., Lancetti, S., Investment strategies and textual analysis signals (2014) Technical Report, , UBS; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Cambria, E., Poria, S., Hazarika, D., Kwok, K., SenticNet 5: Discovering conceptual primitives for sentiment analysis by means of context embeddings (2018) Thirty-second AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, pp. 1795-1802. , AAAI; Chen, K., Zhou, Y., Dai, F., A LSTM-based method for stock returns prediction: A case study of China stock market (2015) 2015 IEEE international conference on big data, pp. 2823-2824. , IEEE; Cho, K., (2014), Van Merriënboer, B., Gulcehre, C., Bahdanau, D., Bougares, F., Schwenk, H., & Bengio, Y.

Maqsood H., Mehmood I., Maqsood M., Yasir M., Afzal S., Aadil F., Selim M.M., Muhammad K.;A local and global event sentiment based efficient stock exchange forecasting using deep learning;2020;International Journal of Information Management;16;Stock exchange forecasting is an important aspect of business investment plans. The customers prefer to invest in stocks rather than traditional investments due to high profitability. The high profit is often linked with high risk due to the nonlinear nature of data and complex economic rules. The stock markets are often volatile and change abruptly due to the economic conditions, political situation and major events for the country. Therefore, to investigate the effect of some major events more specifically global and local events for different top stock companies (country-wise) remains an open research area. In this study, we consider four countries- US, Hong Kong, Turkey, and Pakistan from developed, emerging and underdeveloped economies’ list. We have explored the effect of different major events occurred during 2012–2016 on stock markets. We use the Twitter dataset to calculate the sentiment analysis for each of these events. The dataset consists of 11.42 million tweets that were used to determine the event sentiment. We have used linear regression, support vector regression and deep learning for stock exchange forecasting. The performance of the system is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results show that performance improves by using the sentiment for these events. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;"Deep learning; Event sentiment; Regression; Stock prediction";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Audrino F., Sigrist F., Ballinari D.;The impact of sentiment and attention measures on stock market volatility;2020;International Journal of Forecasting;13;We analyze the impact of sentiment and attention variables on the stock market volatility by using a novel and extensive dataset that combines social media, news articles, information consumption, and search engine data. We apply a state-of-the-art sentiment classification technique in order to investigate the question of whether sentiment and attention measures contain additional predictive power for realized volatility when controlling for a wide range of economic and financial predictors. Using a penalized regression framework, we identify the most relevant variables to be investors’ attention, as measured by the number of Google searches on financial keywords (e.g. “financial market” and “stock market”), and the daily volume of company-specific short messages posted on StockTwits. In addition, our study shows that attention and sentiment variables are able to improve volatility forecasts significantly, although the magnitudes of the improvements are relatively small from an economic point of view. © 2019 The Author(s);"High-dimensional regression; Investor attention; Investor sentiment; Realized volatility; Volatility prediction";"Andersen, T.G., Bollerslev, T., Diebold, F.X., Roughing it up: Including jump components in the measurement, modeling, and forecasting of return volatility (2007) The Review of Economics and Statistics, 89 (4), pp. 701-720; Andersen, T.G., Bollerslev, T., Diebold, F.X., Ebens, H., The distribution of realized stock return volatility (2001) Journal of Financial Economic, 61 (1), pp. 43-76; Andersen, T.G., Bollerslev, T., Diebold, F.X., Labys, P., Modeling and forecasting realized volatility (2003) Econometrica, 71 (2), pp. 579-625; Andersen, T.G., Dobrev, D., Schaumburg, E., Jump-robust volatility estimation using nearest neighbour truncation (2012) Journal of Econometrics, 169 (1), pp. 75-93; Andrei, D., Hasler, M., Investor attention and stock market volatility (2015) Review of Financial Studies, 28 (1), pp. 33-72; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise? the information content of internet stock message boards (2004) The Journal of Finance, 59 (3), pp. 1259-1294; Aouadi, A., Arouri, M., Teulon, F., Investor attention and stock market activity: Evidence from France (2013) Economic Modelling, 35, pp. 674-681; Audrino, F., Camponovo, L., Oracle properties, bias correction, and bootstrap inference for adaptive lasso for time series M-estimators (2018) Journal of Time Series Analysis, 39 (2), pp. 111-128; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Hansen, P.R., Lunde, A., Shephard, N., Realized kernels in practice: trades and quotes (2008) The Econometrics Journal, 12 (3). , C1–C32; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Shephard, N., Econometric analysis of realized volatility and its use in estimating stochastic volatility models (2002) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Ananthi M., Vijayakumar K.;Stock market analysis using candlestick regression and market trend prediction (CKRM);2020;Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing;9;Stock market data is a time-series data in which stock value varies depends on time. Prediction of the stock market is an endeavor to assess the future value of a company’s stock rate which will increase the investor’s profit. The accurate prediction of stock market analysis is still a challenging task. The proposed system predicts stock price of any company mentioned by the user for the next few days. Using the predicted stock price and datasets collected from various sources regarding a certain equity, the overall sentiment of the stock is predicted. The prediction of stock price is done by regression and candlestick pattern detection. The proposed system generates signals on the candlestick graph which allows to predict market movement to a sufficient level of accuracy so that the user is able to judge whether a stock is a ‘Buy/Sell’ and whether to short the stock or go long by delivery. The prediction accuracy of the stock exchange has analyzed and improved to 85% using machine learning algorithms. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;"Candle-stick pattern; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Stock price; Time-series data";"Ahmed, S.T., A study on multi objective optimal clustering techniques for medical datasets (2017) 2017 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems (ICICCS), pp. 174-177. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCONS.2017.8250704, IEEE; Ahmed, S.S.T., Thanuja, K., Guptha, N.S., Narasimha, S., Telemedicine approach for remote patient monitoring system using smart phones with an economical hardware kit (2016) In: 2016 International Conference on Computing Technologies and Intelligent Data Engineering, pp. 1-4. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCTIDE.2016.7725324, IEEE; Ahmed, S.T., Sandhya, M., Sankar, S., A dynamic MooM dataset processing under TelMED protocol design for QoS improvisation of telemedicine environment (2019) J Med Syst, 43 (8), p. 257; Ahmed, S.T., Sandhya, M., Sankar, S., TelMED: dynamic user clustering resource allocation technique for moom datasets under optimizing telemedicine network (2020) Wirel Pers Commun; Fusion model of wavelet transform and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for stock market prediction (2019) J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput, pp. 1-9. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-019-01224-2; Chouhan, L., Agarwal, N., Ishita, P., Saxena S (2018) Stock market prediction using machine learning (2018) First International Conference on Secure Cyber Puttinging and Communications, National Institute of Technology, JALANDHAR, , https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCCC.2018.8703332, Dec; Erdogan, Z., Namli, E., A living environment prediction model using ensemble machine learning techniques based on the quality of life index (2019) J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput; Hiransha, M., Gopalakrishnan, E.A., Menon, V.K., Soman, K.P., NSE stock market prediction using deep-learning models (2018) Elsevier Procedia Comput Sci, 132 (2018), pp. 1351-1362; Kadam, V.J., Jadhav, S.M., Vijayakumar, K., Breast cancer diagnosis using feature ensemble learning based on stacked sparse autoencoders and softmax regression (2019) J Med Syst, 43, p. 263; Kalra, S., Prasad, J.S., Efficacy of news sentiment for stock market prediction (2019) 2019 International Conference on Machine Learning, Big Data, Cloud and Parallel Computing (Com-It-Con), 2019, pp. 491-496. , India, 14th–16th Feb; Martinsson, F., Liljeqvis, I., (2017) Short-Term Stock Market Prediction Based on Candlestick Pattern Analysis, , Thesis; Nakov, P., Ritter, A., Rosenthal, S., Stoyanov, V., Sebastiani, F., SemEval-2016 task 4: Sentiment analysis in Twitter (2016) Proceedings of the 10Th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, , ser.

Jin Z., Yang Y., Liu Y.;Stock closing price prediction based on sentiment analysis and LSTM;2020;Neural Computing and Applications;7;"Stock market prediction has been identified as a very important practical problem in the economic field. However, the timely prediction of the market is generally regarded as one of the most challenging problems due to the stock market’s characteristics of noise and volatility. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning-based stock market prediction model that considers investors’ emotional tendency. First, we propose to involve investors’ sentiment for stock prediction, which can effectively improve the model prediction accuracy. Second, the stock pricing sequence is a complex time sequence with different scales of fluctuations, making the accurate prediction very challenging. We propose to gradually decompose the complex sequence of stock price by adopting empirical modal decomposition (EMD), which yields better prediction accuracy. Third, we adopt LSTM due to its advantages of analyzing relationships among time-series data through its memory function. We further revised it by adopting attention mechanism to focus more on the more critical information. Experiment results show that the revised LSTM model can not only improve prediction accuracy, but also reduce time delay. It is confirmed that investors’ emotional tendency is effective to improve the predicted results; the introduction of EMD can improve the predictability of inventory sequences; and the attention mechanism can help LSTM to efficiently extract specific information and current mission objectives from the information ocean. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.";"Attention mechanism; Empirical mode decomposition; Long short-term memory; Stock market prediction";"Fama, E.F., Market efficiency, long-term returns, and behavioral finance (1998) J Financ Econ, 49 (3), pp. 283-306; Wang, B., Huang, H., Wang, X., A novel text mining approach to financial time series forecasting (2012) Neuro Comput, 83 (6), pp. 136-145; De Gooijer, J.G., Hyndman, R.J., 25 years of IIF time series forecasting: a selective review (2005) Soc Sci Electron Publ, 22 (3), pp. 443-473; Neild, S., A review of time-frequency methods for structural vibration analysis (2003) Eng Struct, 25 (6), pp. 713-728; Krunz, M.M., Makowski, A.M., Modeling video traffic using M/G//splinfin/ input processes: a compromise between Markovian and LRD models (2002) IEEE J Sel Areas Commun, 16 (5), pp. 733-748; Farina, L., Rinaldi, S., Positive linear systems.

Liang C., Tang L., Li Y., Wei Y.;Which sentiment index is more informative to forecast stock market volatility? Evidence from China;2020;International Review of Financial Analysis;5;In this paper, we investigate the predictive ability of three sentiment indices constructed by social media, newspaper, and Internet media news to forecast the realized volatility (RV) of SSEC from in- and out-of-sample perspectives. Our research is based on the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) framework. There are several notable findings. First, the in-sample estimation results suggest that the daily social media and Internet media news sentiment indices have significant impact for stock market volatility, while the sentiment index built by traditional newspaper have no impact. Second, the one-day-ahead out-of-sample forecasting results indicate that the two sentiment indices constructed by social media and Internet media news can considerably improve forecast accuracy. In addition, the model incorporating the positive and negative social media sentiment indices exhibits more superior forecasting performance. Third, we find only the sentiment index built by Internet media news can improve the mid- and long-run volatility predictive accuracy. Fourth, the empirical results based on alternative prediction periods and alternative volatility estimator confirm our conclusions are robust. Finally, we examine the predictability of the monthly sentiment indices and find that the two sentiment indices of social media and Internet media news contain more informative to forecast the monthly RV of SSEC, CSI800, and SZCI, however invalid for CSI300. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.;"Chinese stock market; Forecasting; Realized volatility; Sentiment index";"Adrian, T., Rosenberg, J., Stock returns and volatility: Pricing the short-run and Long-run components of market risk (2008) The Journal of Finance, 63, pp. 2997-3030; Andersen, T.G., Bollerslev, T., Answering the skeptics: Yes, standard volatility models do provide accurate forecasts (1998) International Economic Review, 39, pp. 885-905; Andersen, T.G., Bollerslev, T., Diebold, F.X., Roughing it up: Including jump components in the measurement, modeling, and forecasting of return volatility (2007) The Review of Economics and Statistics, 89, pp. 701-720; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Yang X., Zhu Y., Cheng T.Y.;How the individual investors took on big data: The effect of panic from the internet stock message boards on stock price crash;2020;Pacific Basin Finance Journal;5;This study examines whether the sentiments expressed in the stock forum posted by individual investors lead to abnormal trading and impose a significant impact on stock price crashes. The history of world financial crises reveals that investor panic is one of the most important factors triggering market crashes. In this paper, we propose a measure to estimate investor panic and its effect on a stock price crash. Using Growth Enterprise Market firms in China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange as a sample, we utilize a computer text mining tool to analyze the contents of nearly one million posts from the largest Chinese stock message board. According to the posting contents, we built a daily Sentiment Index and a Panic Index at the firm level. The empirical results show that the high Sentiment Index leads to a significant following abnormal trading. After controlling public information announcements, this effect is still significant. Moreover, the Panic Index could predict the stock price crash. The effect of the Panic Index on the price crash is stronger either when the information disclosure is opaque or when the proportion of shares held by institutional investors is low. © 2019;"Investor panic; Spiral of silence; Stock message board; Stock price crash; Text mining";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M., Is all that talk just noise? the information content of internet stock message boards (2004) J.

Burggraf T., Huynh T.L.D., Rudolf M., Wang M.;Do FEARS drive Bitcoin?;2020;Review of Behavioral Finance;5;Purpose: This study examines the prediction power of investor sentiment on Bitcoin return. Design/methodology/approach: We construct a Financial and Economic Attitudes Revealed by Search (FEARS) index using search volume from Google's search engine to reveal household-level (“bankruptcy”, “unemployment”, “job search”, etc.) and market-level sentiment (“bankruptcy”, “unemployment”, “job search”, etc.). Findings: Using a variety of quantitative methodologies such as the transfer entropy model as well as threshold regression and OLS, GLS and 2SLS estimations, we find that (1) investor sentiment has strong predictive power on Bitcoin, (2) household-level sentiment has larger effects than market-level sentiment and (3) the impact of sentiment is greater in low sentiment regimes than in high sentiment regimes. Based on these information, we build a hypothetical trading strategy that outperforms a simple buy-and-hold strategy both on an absolute and risk-adjusted basis. The results are consistent across cryptocurrencies and regions. Research limitations/implications: The findings contribute to the ongoing debate in the literature on the efficiency of cryptocurrency markets. The results reveal that the Bitcoin market is not efficient in the sense of the efficient market hypothesis – asset prices do not fully reflect all available information and we were able to “beat the market”. In addition, it sheds further light on the debate whether Bitcoin can be considered a medium of exchange, i.e. a currency or an investment product. Because investors are reallocating their Bitcoin holdings during times of increased market sentiment due to liquidity needs, they obviously consider bitcoin an investment product rather than a currency. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine the impact of investor sentiment measured by FEARS on Bitcoin return. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Bitcoin; Investor sentiment; Threshold regression; Transfer entropy";"Aouadi, A., Arouri, M., Teulon, F., Investor attention and stock market activity: evidence from France (2013) Economic Modelling, 35, pp. 674-681; Baek, C., Elbeck, M., Bitcoins as an investment or speculative vehicle?

Khan W., Ghazanfar M.A., Azam M.A., Karami A., Alyoubi K.H., Alfakeeh A.S.;Stock market prediction using machine learning classifiers and social media, news;2020;Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing;5;"Accurate stock market prediction is of great interest to investors; however, stock markets are driven by volatile factors such as microblogs and news that make it hard to predict stock market index based on merely the historical data. The enormous stock market volatility emphasizes the need to effectively assess the role of external factors in stock prediction. Stock markets can be predicted using machine learning algorithms on information contained in social media and financial news, as this data can change investors’ behavior. In this paper, we use algorithms on social media and financial news data to discover the impact of this data on stock market prediction accuracy for ten subsequent days. For improving performance and quality of predictions, feature selection and spam tweets reduction are performed on the data sets. Moreover, we perform experiments to find such stock markets that are difficult to predict and those that are more influenced by social media and financial news. We compare results of different algorithms to find a consistent classifier. Finally, for achieving maximum prediction accuracy, deep learning is used and some classifiers are ensembled. Our experimental results show that highest prediction accuracies of 80.53% and 75.16% are achieved using social media and financial news, respectively. We also show that New York and Red Hat stock markets are hard to predict, New York and IBM stocks are more influenced by social media, while London and Microsoft stocks by financial news. Random forest classifier is found to be consistent and highest accuracy of 83.22% is achieved by its ensemble. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.";"Deep learning; Feature selection; Hybrid algorithm; Natural language processing; Predictive modeling; Sentiment analysis; Stock market prediction";"Afzal, H., Mehmood, K., Spam filtering of bi-lingual tweets using machine learning (2016) IEEE 18Th International Conference on ICACT, pp. 710-714; Alostad, H., Davulcu, H., Directional prediction of stock prices using breaking news on Twitter (2015) IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on WI-IAT 1, pp. 523-530; Al-Zoubi, A., Faris, H., Spam profile detection in social networks based on public features (2017) IEEE 8Th International Conference ICICS, pp. 130-135; Attigeri, G.V., Mm, M.P., Pai, R.M., Nayak, A., Stock market prediction: A big data approach (2015) IEEE Region 10 Conference on TENCON, pp. 1-5; Bastianin, A., Manera, M., How does stock market volatility react to oil price shocks?

Fang J., Gozgor G., Lau C.-K.M., Lu Z.;The impact of Baidu Index sentiment on the volatility of China's stock markets;2020;Finance Research Letters;5;This paper examines the relationship between investor sentiment and the volatility of China's stock markets. We use the data from Baidu, China's leading search engine, for information on investor sentiment. In two different Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models, the baseline model and the Baidu-Index extended model, we forecast the return volatility of China's stock markets. We find that the Baidu-Index extended model performs better than the baseline model. This paper shows that the search volume of relevant key words from Baidu Index improves volatility forecasting of China's stock markets. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;"Baidu-Index; China; GARCH models; investor sentiment; search engine; stock market volatility";"Aalborg, H.A., Molnár, P., de Vries, J.E., What can explain the price, volatility and trading volume of Bitcoin?

Saurabh S., Dey K.;Unraveling the relationship between social moods and the stock market: Evidence from the United Kingdom;2020;Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance;4;This study elucidates plausible relationships between various social moods-dimension and the stock market. To study this phenomenon, we consider a twitter-based data consisting of various moods-dimensions of people residing in the United Kingdom and FTSE 100 index data from January 1, 2010, to October 31, 2014. The findings report that social moods-dimension significantly impacts the market return at the aggregate level. The prediction accuracy measured by the artificial neural network is comparably higher than that of other models, such as support vector machine, discriminant analysis, and decision tree. We also observe that a specific moods-dimension named happy significantly improves the prediction of the index return. While there is no causality between aggregate social moods and the index return, we find bi-directional causality between happy mood-dimension and the market return. However, the intensity of causality from the index return to happy moods is profound. The novelty of our research lies in methodological augmentation and its congruence compared with previous empirical studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;"Artificial neural network; Behavioral finance; Social mood; Stock market; Twitter moods data; United Kingdom";"Baker, M., Wurgler, J., Investor sentiment and the cross-section of stock returns (2006) J.

Maguluri L.P., Rengaswamy R.;An efficient stock market trend prediction using the real-time stock technical data and stock social media data;2020;International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems;4;Stock market trend prediction is one of the major issues which have been problematic to both financial analysts and scientific research on real-time streaming data. Also, forecasting stock market returns based on the technical data is difficult due to noise in the data and mixed data types. As the size of stock technical tools and techniques are increasing along with stock news data, it becomes more difficult to analyze and predict the market trend based on the historical market data. Therefore, it is very challenging task to research institutes and financial brokerages for data analysis and market trend prediction. Since, financial data is unstructured by nature and it is difficult to find an essential feature for intraday bullish and bearish trend prediction. In this work, a new stock technical indicator based non-linear SVM model is designed and implemented on the real-time stock market data for trend prediction. In this model, a novel stock technical data transformation technique, stock technical and text feature extraction method and non-linear SVM classification algorithm are proposed to predict the stock trend on daily and weekly basis. Experimental results have shown that the proposed stock market trend prediction approach has 7% of computational runtime (ms) and an average stock prediction accuracy of 10% as compared to the existing stock market trend prediction models. © 2020, Intelligent Network and Systems Society.;"Sentiment prediction; Stock market prediction; Support vector machine; Trend analysis";"Gadiaa, K., Bhowmick, K., Parallel Text Mining in Multicore Systems Using FP-tree Algorithm (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 45, pp. 111-117; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8. , March; Xianghua, F., Wangwang, L., Yingying, X., Laizhong, C., Combine How Net lexicon to train phrase recursive auto encoder for sentence-level sentiment analysis (2017) Neuro Computing, 241, pp. 18-27; Lin, D., Li, L., Cao, D., Lv, Y., Ke, X., Multi-modality weakly labeled sentiment learning based on Explicit Emotion Signal for Chinese micro blog (2018) Neurocomputing, 272, pp. 258-269; Giatsoglou, M., Vozalis, M.G., Diamantaras, K., Vakali, A., Sarigiannidis, G., Chatzisavvas, K.C., Sentiment analysis leveraging emotions and word embeddings (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 69, p. 214224; Guo, K., Sun, Y., Qian, X., Can investor sentiment be used to predict the stock price?

Bouktif S., Fiaz A., Awad M.;Augmented Textual Features-Based Stock Market Prediction;2020;IEEE Access;4;Due to its dynamics, non-linearity and complexity nature, stock market is inherently difficult to predict. One of the attractive objectives is to predict stock market movement direction by using public sentiments analysis. However, there is an active debate about the usefulness of this approach and the strength of causality between stock market trends and sentiments. The opinions of researchers range from rejecting the relationship to confirming a clear causality between sentiments and trading in stock markets. Nevertheless, many advanced computational methods have adopted sentiment-based features, yet did not attain maturity and performance. In this paper, we are contributing constructively in this debate by empirically investigating the predictability of stock market movement direction using an enhanced method of sentiments analysis. Precisely, we experiment on stock prices history, sentiments polarity, subjectivity, N-grams, customized text-based features in addition to features lags that are used for a finer-grained analysis. Five research questions have been investigated towards answering issues associated with stock market movement prediction using sentiment analysis. We have collected and studied the stocks of ten influential companies belonging to different stock domains in NASDAQ. Our analysis approach is complemented by a sophisticated causality analysis, an algorithmic feature selection and a variety of machine learning techniques including regularized models stacking. A comparison of our approach with other sentiment-based stock market prediction approaches including Deep learning, establishes that our proposed model is performing adequately and predicting stock movements with a higher accuracy of 60%. © 2013 IEEE.;"Machine learning; model stacking; sentiment analysis; stock movement direction prediction; textual features extraction; tweets mining";"Yoo, P.D., Kim, M.H., Jan, T., Machine learning techniques and use of event information for stock market prediction: A survey and evaluation (2005) Proc.

Hao P.-Y., Kung C.-F., Chang C.-Y., Ou J.-B.;Predicting stock price trends based on financial news articles and using a novel twin support vector machine with fuzzy hyperplane;2021;Applied Soft Computing;1;This study extracts the hidden topic model and emotional information from news articles. A novel fuzzy twin support vector machine is also developed to merge the large volume of information from on-line news, using this to predict stock price trends. Fuzzy set theory is very useful for this approach because the texts use fuzzy terminology, such as high/low and big/small, and the boundary between rising and falling categories is poorly defined. By using fuzzy partial ordering relation, the decision function of our approach is generalized such that the values assigned to the stocks fall within a specified range and indicate the membership grade of these stocks in the positive class (rising trends). The proposed approach is useful for dealing with outliers. Outliers only slightly increase the spread of the fuzzy decision boundary and the estimation of the mode of fuzzy hyperplane remains unchanged. Therefore, our model is more robust compared with other methods when the data contain some outliers. Besides, the membership grade estimated by the fuzzy decision boundary gives a better insight into the degree of confidence in the predicted outputs. The explicable characteristic for the degree of confidence is a vital aspect for decision-making applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;"Fuzzy set theory; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Sentiment analysis; Stock price trend prediction; Text mining; Twin support vector machine";"Sezer, O.B., Ozbayoglu, A.M., Algorithmic financial trading with deep convolutional neural networks: Time series to image conversion approach (2018) Appl.

Sirohi C., Jain S., Jha J., Vashist V.;Integrating Behavioral Analytics with LSTM to Get Stock Predictions with Increased Accuracy;2021;Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing;1;Predicting the price of a stock has been one of the most challenging problems, reason being high variations in their price which makes it nearly impossible to find a particular pattern. An attempt is made in this paper to predict the stock prices. We have made use of two machine learning algorithms in two different configurations-one of the models is trained with linear regression and the other one is a recurrent neural networks (RNN). Both these models have been operated in two scenarios, first without sentimental analysis and the second one with sentimental analysis, to analyze the effects of sentiments on stock price. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed system. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;"Linear regression; Recurrent neural networks; Sentimental analysis; Stock market";"Agrawal, J.G., Chourasia, V.S., Mittra, A.K., State-of-the-Art in stock prediction techniques (2013) Int.

Picasso A., Merello S., Ma Y., Oneto L., Cambria E.;Technical analysis and sentiment embeddings for market trend prediction;2019;Expert Systems with Applications;31;Stock market prediction is one of the most challenging problems which has been distressing both researchers and financial analysts for more than half a century. To tackle this problem, two completely opposite approaches, namely technical and fundamental analysis, emerged. Technical analysis bases its predictions on mathematical indicators constructed on the stocks price, while fundamental analysis exploits the information retrieved from news, profitability, and macroeconomic factors. The competition between these schools of thought has led to many interesting achievements, however, to date, no satisfactory solution has been found. Our work aims to combine both technical and fundamental analysis through the application of data science and machine learning techniques. In this paper, the stock market prediction problem is mapped in a classification task of time series data. Indicators of technical analysis and the sentiment of news articles are both exploited as input. The outcome is a robust predictive model able to forecast the trend of a portfolio composed by the twenty most capitalized companies listed in the NASDAQ100 index. As a proof of real effectiveness of our approach, we exploit the predictions to run a high frequency trading simulation reaching more than 80% of annualized return. This project represents a step forward to combine technical and fundamental analysis and provides a starting point for developing new trading strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;"Market trend prediction; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment embeddings; Supervised learning; Technical analysis; Time series analysis";"Abarbanell, J.S., Bushee, B.J., Abnormal returns to a fundamental analysis strategy (1998) Accounting Review, pp. 19-45; Al Shalabi, L., Shaaban, Z., Kasasbeh, B., Data mining: A preprocessing engine (2006) Journal of Computer Science, 2 (9), pp. 735-739; Amin, A., Anwar, S., Adnan, A., Nawaz, M., Howard, N., Qadir, J., Comparing oversampling techniques to handle the class imbalance problem: A customer churn prediction case study (2016) IEEE Access, 4, pp. 7940-7957; Bandy, H., Quantitative trading systems (2007); Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Box, G., Jenkins, G., Time series analysis-forecasting and control.

Ren R., Liu T., Wu D.D.;Forecasting stock market movement direction using sentiment analysis and support vector machine;2019;IEEE Systems Journal;24;Investor sentiment plays an important role on the stock market. User-generated textual content on the Internet provides a precious source to reflect investor psychology and predicts stock prices as a complement to stock market data. This paper integrates sentiment analysis into a machine learning method based on support vector machine. Furthermore, we take the day-of-week effect into consideration and construct more reliable and realistic sentiment indexes. Empirical results illustrate that the accuracy of forecasting the movement direction of the SSE 50 Index can be as high as 89.93% with a rise of 18.6% after introducing sentiment variables. And, meanwhile, our model helps investors make wiser decisions. These findings also imply that sentiment probably contains precious information about the asset fundamental values and can be regarded as one of the leading indicators of the stock market. © 2018 IEEE;"Day-of-week effect; Decision making; Sentiment analysis; Stock markets; Text mining";"Shiller, R.J., (2000) Irrational Exuberance, , Princeton, NJ, USA: Princeton Univ.

Ftiti Z., Hadhri S.;Can economic policy uncertainty, oil prices, and investor sentiment predict Islamic stock returns? A multi-scale perspective;2019;Pacific Basin Finance Journal;19;"This study investigates the causal relationships between economic policy uncertainty, oil prices, investor sentiment, and stock returns of nine Dow Jones Islamic Market Indices. Specifically, this study analyzes the causal effect of these variables on Islamic stock returns at different time scales using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition model. First, we decompose the economic policy uncertainty proxy, oil prices, and investor sentiment into different independent components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs): short-term IMFs designate the effects of irregular events; medium-term IMFs present the effects of extreme events; and long-term IMFs capture long-term effects. Second, we employ a nonlinear non-parametric causality model to test the causal relationship between different variables and Islamic stock returns at both the original and decomposed levels. We find causal relationships between the underlying variables and Islamic stock returns in several time frequencies rather than in the whole sample period. Our results suggest that the use of lagged economic policy uncertainty, oil prices, and investor sentiment may improve the predictability of Islamic stock returns. A test of forecast accuracy indicated the robustness of our results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.";"Economic policy uncertainty; EEMD; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Investor sentiment; Islamic stock returns; Oil prices";"Abdullah, A.M., Saiti, B., Masih, M., The impact of crude oil price on Islamic stock indices of South East Asian countries: evidence from MGARCH-DCC and Wavelet approaches (2016) Borsa Istanbul Rev., 16 (4), pp. 219-232; Hatemi, J.A., Al Shayed, A., Roca, E., The effect of oil prices on stock prices: fresh evidence from asymmetric causality tests (2017) Appl.

Seok S.I., Cho H., Ryu D.;Firm-specific investor sentiment and the stock market response to earnings news;2019;North American Journal of Economics and Finance;17;We link accounting-based anomalies to investors’ behavioral biases and find that investors respond to earnings news differently according to sentiment. The stock price reaction to positive earnings surprises is significantly greater for firms with high sentiment, suggesting that investors are more optimistic about the expected cash flows included in good earnings news for firms with high sentiment. Investors only partially accept information in good earnings news that differs from their expectations for firms with low sentiment. For negative earnings surprises, stock price sensitivity is slightly higher for firms with low sentiment, but this effect is insignificant because investors only partially update their information from bad earnings news regardless of the sentiment level. We observe no difference in the information content of earnings news according to sentiment level that could induce the different stock price sensitivity patterns. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;"Behavioral finance; Earnings announcement return; Firm-specific investor sentiment; Stock market reaction";"Aboody, D., Even-Tov, O., Lehavy, R., Trueman, B., Overnight returns and firm-specific investor sentiment (2018) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 53 (2), pp. 485-505; Baker, M., Stein, J.C., Market liquidity as a sentiment indicator (2004) Journal of Financial Markets, 7 (3), pp. 271-299; Baker, M., Wurgler, J., Investor sentiment and the cross-section of stock returns (2006) Journal of Finance, 61 (4), pp. 1645-1680; Ball, R., Brown, P., An empirical evaluation of accounting income numbers (1968) Journal of Accounting Research, 6 (2), pp. 159-178; Barberis, N., Thaler, R.H., A survey of behavioral finance (2003) Handbook of the economics of finance, volume1B: Financial markets and asset pricing part B, pp. 1053-1128. , G.M.

Nam K., Seong N.;Financial news-based stock movement prediction using causality analysis of influence in the Korean stock market;2019;Decision Support Systems;16;With the advent of the Big Data era and the development of machine learning technologies, predicting stock movements by analyzing news articles, which are unstructured data, has been studied actively. However, so far no attempts have been made to utilize the asymmetric relationship of firms. Thus far, most papers focus on only the target firm, and few papers focus on the target firm and relevant firms together. In this article, we propose a novel machine learning model to forecast stock price movement based on the financial news considering causality. Specifically, our method analyzes the causal relationship between companies, and it accounts for the directional impact within the Global Industry Classification Standard sectors. In our proposed method, transfer entropy is used to find causality, and multiple kernel learning is used to combine features of target firm and causal firms. Based on a Korean market dataset and out-of-sample test, our experimental results reveal that the proposed causal analytic-based framework outperforms two traditional state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed method can predict the stock price directional movements even when there is no financial news on the target firm, but financial news is published on causal firms. Our findings reveal that identifying causal relationship is important in prediction problems, and we suggest that it is important to develop machine learning algorithms and it is also important to find connections with well-established theories such as the complex system theory. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Causal relationship; Multiple kernel learning; Stock movement prediction; Text mining; Transfer entropy";"Nassirtoussi, A.K., Aghabozorgi, S., Wah, T.Y., Ngo, D.C.L., Text mining for market prediction: a systematic review (2014) Expert Syst.

Shah D., Isah H., Zulkernine F.;Predicting the Effects of News Sentiments on the Stock Market;2019;Proceedings - 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2018;14;Stock market forecasting is very important in the planning of business activities. Stock price prediction has attracted many researchers in multiple disciplines including computer science, statistics, economics, finance, and operations research. Recent studies have shown that the vast amount of online information in the public domain such as Wikipedia usage pattern, news stories from the mainstream media, and social media discussions can have an observable effect on investors' opinions towards financial markets. The reliability of the computational models on stock market prediction is important as it is very sensitive to the economy and can directly lead to financial loss. In this paper, we retrieved, extracted, and analyzed the effects of news sentiments on the stock market. Our main contributions include the development of a sentiment analysis dictionary for the financial sector, the development of a dictionary-based sentiment analysis model, and the evaluation of the model for gauging the effects of news sentiments on stocks for the pharmaceutical market. Using only news sentiments, we achieved a directional accuracy of 70.59% in predicting the trends in short-term stock price movement. © 2018 IEEE.;"dictionary comparison; financial market; news articles; sentiment analysis; stock price prediction";"Malagrino, L.S., Roman, N.T., Monteiro, A.M., Forecasting stock market index daily direction: A Bayesia Network approach (2018) Expert Systems with Applications, 105, pp. 11-22; Nguyen, T.H., Shirai, K., Velcin, J., Sentiment analysis on social media for stock movement prediction (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, 42 (24), pp. 9603-9611; Murphy, J.J., Technical analysis of the financial markets: A comprehensive guide to trading methods and applications (1999) Penguin; Zhang, J., Cui, S., Xu, Y., Li, Q., Li, T., A novel data-driven stock price trend prediction system (2018) Expert Systems with Applications, 97, pp. 60-69; Huynh, H.D., Dang, L.M., Duong, D., A new model for stock price movements prediction using deep neural network (2017) Proceedings of the Eighth International Symposium on Information and Communication Technology, pp. 57-62. , ACM; Chong, E., Han, C., Park, F.C., Deep learning networks for stock market analysis and prediction: Methodology, data representations, and case studies (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 187-205; Yeh, C.-Y., Huang, C.-W., Lee, S.-J., A multiple-kernel support vector regression approach for stock market price forecasting (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (3), pp. 2177-2186; Guresen, E., Kayakutlu, G., Daim, T.U., Using artificial neural network models in stock market index prediction (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (8), pp. 10389-10397; Wei, P., Wang, N., Wikipedia and stock return: Wikipedia usage pattern helps to predict the individual stock movement (2016) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web, pp. 591-594. , International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee; Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Foundations and Trends® in Information Retrieval, 2 (1-2), pp. 1-135; Isah, H., Social data mining for crime intelligence: Contributions to social data quality assessment and prediction methods (2017) University of Bradford; Mittal, A., Goel, A., (2011) Stock Prediction Using Twitter Sentiment Analysis, , http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2011/GoelMittal-StockMarketPredictionUsingTwitterSentimentAnalysis.pdf, Standford University CS229 15 2012; Li, H., Mukherjee, A., Liu, B., Kornfield, R., Emery, S., Detecting campaign promoters on twitter using markov random fields (2014) Data Mining (ICDM), 2014 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 290-299. , IEEE; Li, Q., Shah, S., Learning stock market sentiment lexicon and sentiment-oriented word vector from stocktwits (2017) Proceedings of the 21st Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pp. 301-310";2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2018;Conference Paper
Asghar M.Z., Rahman F., Kundi F.M., Ahmad S.;Development of stock market trend prediction system using multiple regression;2019;Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory;13;The Stock market trend prediction is an efficient medium for investors, public companies and government to invest money by taking into account the profit and risk. The existing studies on the development of stock-based prediction systems rely on data acquired from social media sources (sentiment-based) and secondary data sources (financial-sites). However, the data acquired from such sources is usually sparse in nature. Moreover, the selection of predictor variables is also poor, which ultimately degrades the performance of prediction model. The problems associated with existing approaches can be overcome by proposing an effective prediction model with improved quality of input data and enhanced selection/inclusion of predictor variables.

Maguluri L.P., Ragupathy R.;A new sentiment score based improved bayesian networks for real-time intraday stock trend classification;2019;International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering;12;The stock sentiment score is an important trend indicator for an enterprise and several factors may affect its value. Various events such as stock news, quarterly results and company announcements may differ in public emotion and sentiments, which may affect stock market trend. Due to variation in stock trend and news, stock market forecasting remains a challenging task in real-time market. However, most of the traditional sentiment analysis approaches are not directly predicting the sentiment score and its trend on the online stock market sites due to data sparsity and uncertainty problems. In order to overcome these problems, a hybrid probabilistic based stock sentiment prediction model is designed and implemented based on the real-time market data. In the proposed model, real-time stock data such as stocks technical, stocks news, stock momentum etc. are integrated to predict the buying or selling behavior of the investor. A novel stock sentiment score and data transformation methods are implemented to normalize the market trend for intraday data. Finally, an improved Bayesian networks technique is implemented on the filtered data to predict and test the trend of the stock on the filtered data. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is more efficient than the traditional sentiment classification models in terms of accuracy and error rate are concerned. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Wang H., Lu S., Zhao J.;Aggregating multiple types of complex data in stock market prediction: A model-independent framework;2019;Knowledge-Based Systems;12;The increasing richness in the volume and types of data in the financial domain provides unprecedented opportunities for understanding the stock market more comprehensively and makes price predictions more accurate than before. However, this situation also brings challenges to classic statistical approaches since these models might be constrained to a certain type of data. Aiming to aggregate information from different sources and to offer type-free capability to existing models, a framework for predicting the stock market in scenarios with mixed data, including scalar data, compositional data (pie-like) and functional data (curve-like), is established. The presented framework is model-independent because it serves as an interface to multiple types of data and can be combined with various prediction models. Moreover, the framework is proven to be effective through numerical simulations. For price prediction, we incorporate the trading volume (scalar data), intraday return series (functional data), and investors’ emotions from social media (compositional data) through the framework to competently forecast the market trend at opening on the next day. The strong explanatory power of the framework is further demonstrated. Specifically, the intraday returns are found to impact the following opening prices differently between a bearish market and a bullish market. Additionally, it is not at the beginning of the bearish market but rather the subsequent period in which the investors’ “fear” becomes indicative. This framework would help to easily extend existing prediction models to scenarios with multiple types of data and to provide a more systemic understanding of the stock market. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Complex data; Data aggregation; Heterogeneous data; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Stock market";"Harris, L., A transaction data study of weekly and intradaily patterns in stock returns (1986) J.

Groß-Klußmann A., König S., Ebner M.;Buzzwords build momentum: Global financial Twitter sentiment and the aggregate stock market;2019;Expert Systems with Applications;11;We examine the long-term relationship between signals derived from nine years of unstructured social media microblog text data and financial market developments in five major economic regions. Employing statistical language modeling techniques we construct directional sentiment metrics and link these to aggregate stock index returns. To address the noise in finance-related Twitter messages we identify expert users whose tweets predominantly focus on finance topics. We document that expert users are the main drivers behind an interdependence between Twitter sentiment and financial markets. The direct prediction value of expert sentiment metrics for stock index returns, however, is found to be elusive and short-lived. Yet, we detect significant predictive gains over benchmark models in times of negative market returns. In consequence, the relation between expert sentiment metrics and stock indices is sufficient to devise hypothetically profitable cross-sectional as well as time series momentum investment strategies for futures based on Twitter signals that survive basic transaction cost assumptions. In this context, our results show that expert sentiment signals can yield higher risk-adjusted returns than classical price-based signals. © 2019 The Authors;"Alternative data; Sentiment extraction; Social media data; Text mining in finance; Trend-Following";"Albuquerque, R., Skewness in stock returns: Reconciling the evidence on firm versus aggregate returns (2012) The Review of Financial Studies, 25 (5), pp. 1630-1673; Andersen, T.G., Bollerslev, T., Diebold, F.X., Labys, P., Modeling and forecasting realized volatility (2003) Econometrica, 71 (2), pp. 579-625; Andrzejewski, D., Zhu, X., Craven, M., Recht, B., A framework for incorporating general domain knowledge into latent Dirichlet allocation using first-order logic (2011) Proceedings of the twenty-second international joint conference on artificial intelligence - volume two, IJCAI’11, pp. 1171-1177. , AAAI Press; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Xing F.Z., Cambria E., Zhang Y.;Sentiment-aware volatility forecasting;2019;Knowledge-Based Systems;11;Recent advances in the integration of deep recurrent neural networks and statistical inferences have paved new avenues for joint modeling of moments of random variables, which is highly useful for signal processing, time series analysis, and financial forecasting. However, introducing explicit knowledge as exogenous variables has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel model termed sentiment-aware volatility forecasting (SAVING), which incorporates market sentiment for stock return fluctuation prediction. Our framework provides an ensemble of symbolic and sub-symbolic AI approaches, that is, including grounded knowledge into a connectionist neural network. The model aims at producing a more accurate estimation of temporal variances of asset returns by better capturing the bi-directional interaction between movements of asset price and market sentiment. The interaction is modeled using Variational Bayes via the data generation and inference operations. We benchmark our model with 9 other popular ones in terms of the likelihood of forecasts given the observed sequence. Experimental results suggest that our model not only outperforms pure statistical models, e.g., GARCH and its variants, Gaussian-process volatility model, but also outperforms the state-of-the-art autoregressive deep neural nets architectures, such as the variational recurrent neural network and the neural stochastic volatility model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;"Financial text mining; Sentiment knowledge; Time series analysis; Variational neural networks; Volatility modeling";"Markowitz, H., Portfolio selection (1952) J.

Ding W., Mazouz K., Wang Q.;Investor sentiment and the cross-section of stock returns: new theory and evidence;2019;Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting;10;We extend the noise trader risk model of Delong et al. (J Polit Econ 98:703–738, 1990) to a model with multiple risky assets to demonstrate the effect of investor sentiment on the cross-section of stock returns. Our model formally demonstrates that market-wide sentiment leads to relatively higher contemporaneous returns and lower subsequent returns for stocks that are more prone to sentiment and difficult to arbitrage. Our extended model is consistent with the existing empirical evidence on the relationship between sentiment and cross-sectional stock returns. Guided by the extended model, wen also decompose investor sentiment into long- and short-run components and predict that long-run sentiment negatively associates with the cross-sectional return and short-run sentiment positively varies with the cross-sectional return. Consistent with these predictions, we find a negative relationship between the long-run sentiment component and subsequent stock returns and positive association between the short-run sentiment component and contemporaneous stock returns. © 2018, The Author(s).;"Investor sentiment; Noise trader risk; Predictive return";"Aboody, D., Even-Tov, O., Lehavy, R., Trueman, B., Overnight returns and firm-specific investor sentiment (2018) J Financ Quant Anal, 53, pp. 485-505; Amihud, Y., Hurvich, C.M., Wang, Y., Multiple-predictor regressions: hypothesis testing (2009) Rev Financ Stud, 22, pp. 413-434; Baker, M., Wurgler, J., Investor sentiment and the cross-section of stock returns (2006) J Finance, 61, pp. 1645-1680; Baker, M., Wurgler, J., Investor sentiment in the stock market (2007) J Econ Perspect, 21, pp. 129-151; Baker, M., Wurgler, J., Yuan, Y., Global, local, and contagious investor sentiment (2012) J Financ Econ, 104, pp. 272-287; Barber, B.M., Odean, T., All that glitters: the effect of attention and news on the buying behavior of individual and institutional investors (2008) Rev Financ Stud, 21, pp. 785-818; Barberis, N., Shleifer, A., Vishny, R., A model of investor sentiment (1998) J Financ Econ, 49, pp. 307-343; Ben-Rephael, A., Kandel, S., Wohl, A., Measuring investor sentiment with mutual fund flows (2012) J Financ Econ, 104, pp. 363-382; Berger, D., Turtle, H., Cross-sectional performance and investor sentiment in a multiple risk factor model (2012) J Bank Finance, 36, pp. 1107-1121; Beveridge, S., Nelson, C.R., A new approach to decomposition of economic time series into permanent and transitory components with particular attention to measurement of the ‘business cycle’ (1981) J Monetary Econ, 7, pp. 151-174; Bhattacharya, U., Galpin, N., Ray, R., Yu, X., The role of the media in the internet IPO bubble (2009) J Financ Quant Anal, 44, pp. 657-682; Brown, G.W., Cliff, M.T., Investor sentiment and the near-term stock market (2004) J Empir Finance, 11, pp. 1-27; Brown, G.W., Cliff, M.T., Investor sentiment and asset valuation (2005) J Bus, 78, pp. 405-440; Campbell, J.Y., Kyle, A.S., Smart Money, Noise trading and stock price behaviour (1993) Rev Econ Stud, 60, pp. 1-34; Carhart, M.M., On persistence in mutual fund performance (1997) J Finance, 52, pp. 57-82; Chen, C., Kuo, I., Investor sentiment and interest rate volatility smile: evidence from Eurodollar options markets (2014) Rev Quant Financ Acc, 43, pp. 367-391; Chen, N.-F., Kan, R., Miller, M.H., Are the discounts on closed-end funds a sentiment index?

Knoll J., Stübinger J., Grottke M.;Exploiting social media with higher-order Factorization Machines: statistical arbitrage on high-frequency data of the S&P 500;2019;Quantitative Finance;9;Over the past 15 years, there have been a number of studies using text mining for predicting stock market data. Two recent publications employed support vector machines and second-order Factorization Machines, respectively, to this end. However, these approaches either completely neglect interactions between the features extracted from the text, or they only account for second-order interactions. In this paper, we apply higher-order Factorization Machines, for which efficient training algorithms have only been available since 2016. As Factorization Machines require hyperparameters to be specified, we also introduce a novel adaptive-order algorithm for automatically determining them. Our study is the first one to make use of social media data for predicting minute-by-minute stock returns, namely the ones of the S&P 500 stock constituents. We show that, unlike a trading strategy employing support vector machines, Factorization-Machine-based strategies attain positive returns after transactions costs for the years 2014 and 2015. Especially the approach applying the adaptive-order algorithm outperforms classical approaches with respect to a multitude of criteria, and it features very favorable characteristics. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;"Factorization Machine; Finance; High-frequency trading; Machine learning; Social media; Statistical arbitrage";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Stock prices are hard to predict because of their high volatile nature which depends on diverse political and economic factors, change of leadership, investor sentiment, and many other factors. Predicting stock prices based on either historical data or textual information alone has proven to be insufficient. Existing studies in sentiment analysis have found that there is a strong correlation between the movement of stock prices and the publication of news articles. Several sentiment analysis studies have been attempted at various levels using algorithms such as support vector machines, naive Bayes regression, and deep learning. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms depends upon the amount of training data provided. However, the amount of textual data collected and analyzed during the past studies has been insufficient and thus has resulted in predictions with low accuracy. In our paper, we improve the accuracy of stock price predictions by gathering a large amount of time series data and analyzing it in relation to related news articles, using deep learning models. The dataset we have gathered includes daily stock prices for S&P500 companies for five years, along with more than 265,000 financial news articles related to these companies. Given the large size of the dataset, we use cloud computing as an invaluable resource for training prediction models and performing inference for a given stock in real time. © 2019 IEEE.;"Big data; Cloud computing; Machine learning; Regression; Stock market prediction";"Alostad, H., Davulcu, H., Directional prediction of stock prices using breaking news on twitter (2015) 2015 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WIIAT), 1, pp. 523-530. , Dec; Li, X., Xie, H., Song, Y., Zhu, S., Li, Q., Wang, F.L., Does summarization help stock prediction?

Chen M.-Y., Liao C.-H., Hsieh R.-P.;Modeling public mood and emotion: Stock market trend prediction with anticipatory computing approach;2019;Computers in Human Behavior;7;The science and technology is more and more developed. Digital media such as articles, commentary, videos, animations and others on the Internet is becoming more and more important. English semantic analysis has many basic technologies, many applications are also gradually budding in this basic technology. On the other hand, there is no uniform or complete reorganization of the basic technologies in Chinese semantic analysis. Chinese semantic analysis is difficult than English semantic analysis because it is difficult to judge the true meaning of Chinese words and sentences. This study collects articles about common news sites in Taiwan and related to individual stocks. After the data is preprocessed and Skip-gram, each word is converted to word features using Word2Vec. The Lexicon stores the most relevant words around the keyword. In the prediction stage, this study calculates the impact of new articles on the stock price according to the full training lexicon. Finally, this study uses the deep learning approach - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to evaluate the final results. The aim of this study is to adopt anticipatory computing to explore the public mood and emotion from news articles. Then this study can predict the future stock market trend and can be the reference model to the related industries. © 2019;"Emantic analysis; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Stock market trend analysis; Time series";"Araque, O., Corcuera-Platas, I., Sanchez-Rada, J.F., Iglesias, C.A., Enhancing deep learning sentiment analysis with ensemble techniques in social applications (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 77, pp. 236-246; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of computational science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Fu, X., Liu, W., Xu, Y., Cui, L., Combine HowNet lexicon to train phrase recursive autoencoder for sentence-level sentiment analysis (2017) Neurocomputing, 241, pp. 18-27; Gadia, K., Bhowmick, K., Parallel text mining in multicore systems using FP-Tree algorithm (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 45, pp. 111-117; Giatsoglou, M., Vozalis, M.G., Diamantaras, K., Vakali, A., Sarigiannidis, G., Chatzisavvas, K.C., Sentiment analysis leveraging emotions and word embeddings (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 69, pp. 214-224; Guo, K., Sun, Y., Qian, X., Can investor sentiment be used to predict the stock price?

Derakhshan A., Beigy H.;Sentiment analysis on stock social media for stock price movement prediction;2019;Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence;7;The opinions of other people are an essential piece of information for making informed decisions. With the increase in using the Internet, today the web becomes an excellent source of user's viewpoints in different domains. However, in one hand, the growing volume of opinionated text and on the other hand, complexity caused by contrast in user opinion, makes it almost impossible to read all of these reviews and make an informed decision. These requirements have encouraged a new line of research on mining user reviews, which is called opinion mining. User's viewpoints could change during the time, and this is an important issue for companies. One of the most challenging problems of opinion mining is model-based opinion mining, which aim to model the generation of words by modeling their probabilities. In this paper, we address the problem of model-based opinion mining by introducing a part-of-speech graphical model to extract user's opinions and test it in two different datasets in English and Persian where the Persian dataset is gathered in this paper from Iranian stock market social network. In the prediction of the stock market by this model, we achieved an accuracy better than methods that are using explicit sentiment labels for comments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;"Model-based opinion mining; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Stock prediction";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise? the information content of internet stock message boards (2004) J.

Yadav R., Kumar A.V., Kumar A.;News-based supervised sentiment analysis for prediction of futures buying behaviour;2019;IIMB Management Review;7;This study examines the predictability of real-time news data on investors’ buying behaviour in the futures market, using supervised sentiment analysis. Market sentiment or traders’ buying behaviour is captured at the bid-ask stage of price formation using the net buying pressure (NBP). Any significant change in NBP patterns defines an “interesting market event”. Real-time news headlines are automatically labelled using interesting market events, assuming a lag between the market information and its impact on buying behaviour. News was found to have an impact on the market buying behaviour of the S&P NIFTY index futures with an optimal lag of 5 minutes. Manual labelling of the news data validated this empirical finding. © 2019;"Futures market; Net buying pressure; Prediction; Real-time news; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machines; Trade direction; Vector space model";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Seifollahi S., Shajari M.;Word sense disambiguation application in sentiment analysis of news headlines: an applied approach to FOREX market prediction;2019;Journal of Intelligent Information Systems;7;Sentiment analysis of textual content has become a popular approach for market prediction. However, lack of a process for word sense disambiguation makes it questionable whether the sentiment expressed by the context is correctly identified. Meanwhile, many studies in natural language processing have focused on word sense disambiguation. However, there has been a weak link between the two logically relevant fields of study. Therefore, with two motivations, we propose a system for FOREX market prediction that exploits word sense disambiguation in sentiment analysis of news headlines and predicts the directional movement of a currency pair. The first motivation is the implementation of a novel word sense disambiguation that can determine the proper senses of all significant words in a news headline. The main contributions of this work that make the first motivation possible, are the introduction of novel approaches termed Relevant Gloss Retrieval, Similarity Threshold, Verb Nominalization, and also optimization measures to decrease execution time. The second motivation is to prove that determination of proper senses of significant words in textual contents can improve the determination of sentiment, conveyed by the context, and consequently any application based on sentiment analysis. Inclusion of the word sense disambiguation into the proposed system proves the achievement of the second motivation. Carried out tests with the same dataset prove that the proposed system outperforms one of the best systems (to our best knowledge) proposed for market prediction and improves accuracy from 83.33% to 91.67%. The detail for reproduction of the system is amply provided. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;"FOREX prediction; Polysemous word; Semantic analysis; Sentiment analysis; Word sense disambiguation";"Anastasakis, L., Mort, N., Exchange rate forecasting using a combined parametric and nonparametric self-organising modelling approach (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (10), pp. 12001-12011; Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., Sentiwordnet 3.0: an enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2010) In LREC, 10, pp. 2200-2204; Banerjee, S., Pedersen, T., An adapted lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation using wordnet (2002) International conference on intelligent text processing and computational linguistics, pp. 136-145. , &, (,).,.

Kalra S., Prasad J.S.;Efficacy of News Sentiment for Stock Market Prediction;2019;Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, Big Data, Cloud and Parallel Computing: Trends, Prespectives and Prospects, COMITCon 2019;7;Stock Market trend prediction will always remain a challenging task due to stochastic nature. The enormous amount of data generated by the news, blogs, reviews, financial reports and social media are considered a treasure of knowledge for researchers and investors. The present work focuses to observe fluctuations in stock prices with respect to the relevant news articles of a company. In this paper, a daily prediction model is proposed using historical data and news articles to predict the Indian stock market movements. Classifier Naïve Bayes is used to categorize the news text having negative or positive sentiment. The count of the positive and negative sentiment of news articles for each day and variance of adjacent days close price along with historical data is used for prediction purpose and an accuracy ranging from 65.30 to 91.2 % achieved with various machine learning techniques. © 2019 IEEE.;"Machine learning; News Sentiment; Sentiment analysis; social media analytics; Stock price prediction";"Bogle, S.A., Potter, W.D., Sentamal-a sentiment analysis machine learning stock predictive model (2015) Proc. of Int.

Ratto A.P., Merello S., Oneto L., Ma Y., Malandri L., Cambria E.;Ensemble of Technical Analysis and Machine Learning for Market Trend Prediction;2019;Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2018;7;Over the last twenty years, researchers and practitioners have attempted in many ways to effectively predict market trends. Till date, however, no satisfactory solution has been found. Many approaches have been applied to predict market trends, from technical analysis to fundamental analysis passing through sentiment analysis. A promising research direction is to exploit market technical indicators together with market sentiments extracted from social media for predicting market directional movements. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages technical analysis to predict market directional movements. In particular, we aim to predict the directional movement of the NASDAQ's most capitalized stocks by solving a classification problem. The results on real-world data show that our proposal achieves interesting performance when predicting the market directional movements. This work focuses on forecasting a portfolio of different stocks, instead of concentrating on a single stock which most of the works in this field do. Furthermore, the proposed model is able to solve the issue of skewed classes through the use of appropriate data balancing techniques. © 2018 IEEE.;"Market Trend Prediction; Technical Analysis";"Fama, E.F., Efficient capital markets: II (1991) The Journal of Finance, 46 (5), pp. 1575-1617; Lo, A.W., The adaptive markets hypothesis: Market efficiency from an evolutionary perspective (2004) Journal of Portfolio Management, , Forthcoming; Abarbanell, J.S., Bushee, B.J., Abnormal returns to a fundamental analysis strategy (1998) Accounting Review, pp. 19-45; Xing, F., Cambria, E., Welsch, R., Natural language based financial forecasting: A survey (2018) Artificial Intelligence Review, 50 (1), pp. 49-73; Xing, F.Z., Cambria, E., Malandri, L., Vercellis, C., Discovering Bayesian market views for intelligent asset allocation (2018) ECML; Yao, J., Tan, C.L., Poh, H.-L., Neural networks for technical analysis: A study on klci (1999) International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance, 2 (2), pp. 221-241; Hu, Z., Liu, W., Bian, J., Liu, X., Liu, T.-Y., Listening to chaotic whispers: A deep learning framework for news-oriented stock trend prediction (2018) Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining.

Weng B., Lu L., Wang X., Megahed F.M., Martinez W.;Predicting short-term stock prices using ensemble methods and online data sources;2018;Expert Systems with Applications;44;"With the ubiquity of the Internet, platforms such as: Google, Wikipedia and the like can provide insights pertaining to firms’ financial performance as well as capture the collective interest of traders through search trends, number of web page visitors and/or financial news sentiment. Information emanating from these platforms can significantly affect, or be affected by, changes in the stock market. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop a financial expert system that incorporates these features to predict short term stock prices. Our expert system is comprised of two main modules: a knowledge base and an artificial intelligence (AI) platform. The “knowledge base” for our expert system captures: (a) historical stock prices; (b) several well-known technical indicators; (c) counts and sentiment scores of published news articles for a given stock; (d) trends in Google searches for the given stock ticker; and (e) number of unique visitors for pertinent Wikipedia pages. Once the data is collected, we use a structured approach for data preparation. Then, the AI platform trains four machine learning ensemble methods: (a) a neural network regression ensemble; (b) a support vector regression ensemble; (c) a boosted regression tree; and (d) a random forest regression. In the cross-validation phase, the AI platform picks the “best” ensemble for a given stock. To evaluate the efficacy of our expert system, we first present a case study based on the Citi Group stock ($C) with data collected from 01/01/2013 - 12/31/2016. We show the expert system can predict the 1-day ahead $C stock price with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) ≤ 1.50% and the 1–10 day ahead with a MAPE ≤ 1.89%, which is better than the reported results in the literature. We show that the use of features extracted from online sources does not substitute the traditional financial metrics, but rather supplements them to improve upon the prediction performance of machine learning based methods. To highlight the utility and generalizability of our expert system, we predict the 1-day ahead price of 19 additional stocks from different industries, volatilities and growth patterns. We report an overall mean for the MAPE statistic of 1.07% across our five different machine learning models, including a MAPE of under 0.75% for 18 of the 19 stocks for the best ensemble (boosted regression tree). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd";"Big data; Ensembles; Google trends; R programming; Sentiment analysis; Wikipedia";"Abdullah, M., Ganapathy, V., Neural network ensemble for financial trend prediction (2000) Tencon 2000. proceedings, 3, pp. 157-161. , IEEE; Alkhatib, K., Najadat, H., Hmeidi, I., Shatnawi, M.K.A., Stock price prediction using k-nearest neighbor (knn) algorithm (2013) International Journal of Business, Humanities and Technology, 3 (3), pp. 32-44; Araújo, R.D.A., Oliveira, A.L., Meira, S., A hybrid model for high-frequency stock market forecasting (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, 42 (8), pp. 4081-4096; Arlot, S., Celisse, A., A survey of cross-validation procedures for model selection (2010) Statistics surveys, 4, pp. 40-79; Ballings, M., Van den Poel, D., Hespeels, N., Gryp, R., Evaluating multiple classifiers for stock price direction prediction (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, 42 (20), pp. 7046-7056; Barak, S., Modarres, M., Developing an approach to evaluate stocks by forecasting effective features with data mining methods (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, 42 (3), pp. 1325-1339; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Booth, A., Gerding, E., Mcgroarty, F., Automated trading with performance weighted random forests and seasonality (2014) Expert Systems with Applications, 41 (8), pp. 3651-3661; Boser, B.E., Guyon, I.M., Vapnik, V.N., A training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers (1992) Proceedings of the fifth annual workshop on computational learning theory, pp. 144-152. , ACM; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45 (1), pp. 5-32; Chen, Y., Hao, Y., A feature weighted support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor algorithm for stock market indices prediction (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 80, pp. 340-355; Chen, Y., Yang, B., Abraham, A., Flexible neural trees ensemble for stock index modeling (2007) Neurocomputing, 70 (4), pp. 697-703; Chong, E., Han, C., Park, F.C., Deep learning networks for stock market analysis and prediction: Methodology, data representations, and case studies (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 187-205; Cootner, P., The random character of stock market prices (1964), M.I.T.

Zhang X., Zhang Y., Wang S., Yao Y., Fang B., Yu P.S.;Improving stock market prediction via heterogeneous information fusion;2018;Knowledge-Based Systems;44;Traditional stock market prediction approaches commonly utilize the historical price-related data of the stocks to forecast their future trends. As the Web information grows, recently some works try to explore financial news to improve the prediction. Effective indicators, e.g., the events related to the stocks and the people's sentiments toward the market and stocks, have been proved to play important roles in the stocks’ volatility, and are extracted to feed into the prediction models for improving the prediction accuracy. However, a major limitation of previous methods is that the indicators are obtained from only a single source whose reliability might be low, or from several data sources but their interactions and correlations among the multi-sourced data are largely ignored. In this work, we extract the events from Web news and the users’ sentiments from social media, and investigate their joint impacts on the stock price movements via a coupled matrix and tensor factorization framework. Specifically, a tensor is firstly constructed to fuse heterogeneous data and capture the intrinsic relations among the events and the investors’ sentiments. Due to the sparsity of the tensor, two auxiliary matrices, the stock quantitative feature matrix and the stock correlation matrix, are constructed and incorporated to assist the tensor decomposition. The intuition behind is that stocks that are highly correlated with each other tend to be affected by the same event. Thus, instead of conducting each stock prediction task separately and independently, we predict multiple correlated stocks simultaneously through their commonalities, which are enabled via sharing the collaboratively factorized low rank matrices between matrices and the tensor. Evaluations on the China A-share stock data and the HK stock data in the year 2015 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2017;"Social media; Stock correlation; Stock prediction; Tensor factorization";"Fama, E.F., The behavior of stock-market prices (1965) J.

Lien Minh D., Sadeghi-Niaraki A., Huy H.D., Min K., Moon H.;Deep learning approach for short-term stock trends prediction based on two-stream gated recurrent unit network;2018;IEEE Access;40;"Financial news has been proven to be a crucial factor which causes fluctuations in stock prices. However, previous studies heavily relied on analyzing shallow features and ignored the structural relation among words in a sentence. Several sentiment analysis studies have tried to point out the relationship between investors' reaction and news events. However, the sentiment dataset was usually constructed from the lingual dataset which is unrelated to the financial sector and led to poor performance. This paper proposes a novel framework to predict the directions of stock prices by using both financial news and sentiment dictionary. The original contributions of this paper include the proposal of a novel two-stream gated recurrent unit network and Stock2Vec - a sentiment word embedding trained on financial news dataset and Harvard IV-4. Two main experiments are conducted: the first experiment predicts S&P 500 index stock price directions using the historical SP 500 prices and the articles crawled from Reuters and Bloomberg, and the second experiment forecasts the price trends of VN-index using VietStock news and stock prices from cophieu68. Results show that: 1) two-stream GRU outperforms state-of-the-art models; 2) Stock2Vec is more efficient in dealing with financial datasets; and 3) applying the model, a simulation scenario proves that our model is effective for the stock sector. © 2013 IEEE.";"Deep learning; natural language processing; sentiment analysis; stock trends";"Bastianin, A., Manera, M., How does stock market volatility react to oil price shocks?

Xu Y., Cohen S.B.;Stock movement prediction from tweets and historical prices;2018;ACL 2018 - 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference (Long Papers);38;Stock movement prediction is a challenging problem: the market is highly stochastic, and we make temporally-dependent predictions from chaotic data. We treat these three complexities and present a novel deep generative model jointly exploiting text and price signals for this task. Unlike the case with discriminative or topic modeling, our model introduces recurrent, continuous latent variables for a better treatment of stochasticity, and uses neural variational inference to address the intractable posterior inference. We also provide a hybrid objective with temporal auxiliary to flexibly capture predictive dependencies. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed model on a new stock movement prediction dataset which we collected. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics;;"Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.S., Devin, M., (2016) Tensorflow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems, , arXiv preprint;

Zhang X., Qu S., Huang J., Fang B., Yu P.;Stock Market Prediction via Multi-Source Multiple Instance Learning;2018;IEEE Access;27;Forecasting the stock market movements is an important and challenging task. As the Web information grows, researchers begin to extract effective indicators (e.g., the events and sentiments) from the Web to facilitate the prediction. However, the indicators obtained in previous studies are usually based on only one data source and thus may not fully cover the factors that can affect the stock market movements. In this paper, to improve the prediction for stock market composite index movements, we exploit the consistencies among different data sources, and develop a multi-source multiple instance model that can effectively combine events, sentiments, as well as the quantitative data into a comprehensive framework. To effectively capture the news events, we successfully apply a novel event extraction and representation method. Evaluations on the data from the year 2015 and 2016 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. In addition, our approach is able to automatically determine the importance of each data source and identify the crucial input information that is considered to drive the movements, making the predictions interpretable. © 2013 IEEE.;"event extraction; multiple instance; sentiment analysis; Stock prediction";"Fama, E.F., The behavior of stock-market prices (1965) J.

Chiong R., Adam M.T.P., Fan Z., Lutz B., Hu Z., Neumann D.;A sentiment analysis-based machine learning approach for financial market prediction via news disclosures;2018;GECCO 2018 Companion - Proceedings of the 2018 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion;22;Stock market prediction plays an important role in financial decision-making for investors. Many of them rely on news disclosures to make their decisions in buying or selling stocks. However, accurate modelling of stock market trends via news disclosures is a challenging task, considering the complexity and ambiguity of natural languages used. Unlike previous work along this line of research, which typically applies bag-of-words to extract tens of thousands of features to build a prediction model, we propose a sentiment analysis-based approach for financial market prediction using news disclosures. Specifically, sentiment analysis is carried out in the pre-processing phase to extract sentiment-related features from financial news. Historical stock market data from the perspective of time series analysis is also included as an input feature. With the extracted features, we use a support vector machine (SVM) to build the prediction model, with its parameters optimised through particle swarm optimisation (PSO). Experimental results show that our proposed SVM and PSO-based model is able to obtain better results than a deep learning model in terms of time and accuracy. The results presented here are to date the best in the literature based on the financial news dataset tested. This excellent performance is attributed to the sentiment analysis done during the pre-processing stage, as it reduces the feature dimensions significantly. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).;"Financial market prediction; Particle swarm optimisation; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machine";"Clerc, M., (2010) Particle Swarm Optimization, 93. , John Wiley & Sons; Devitt, A., Ahmad, K., Sentiment polarity identification in financial news: A cohesion-based approach (2007) ACL, 7, pp. 984-991; Hagenau, M., Liebmann, M., Neumann, D., Automated news reading: Stock price prediction based on financial news using context-capturing features (2013) Decision Support Systems, 55 (3), pp. 685-697. , 2013; Hu, Z., Bao, Y., Chiong, R., Xiong, T., Profit guided or statistical error guided? a study of stock index forecasting using support vector regression (2017) Journal of Systems Science and Complexity, 30 (6), pp. 1425-1442. , 2017; Kraus, M., Feuerriegel, S., Decision support from financial disclosures with deep neural networks and transfer learning (2017) Decision Support Systems, 104, pp. 38-48. , 2017; Manning, C.D., Schütze, H., (1999) Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, , MIT press; Vapnik, V., (2013) The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory, , Springer";2018 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2018;Conference Paper
Behrendt S., Schmidt A.;The Twitter myth revisited: Intraday investor sentiment, Twitter activity and individual-level stock return volatility;2018;Journal of Banking and Finance;19;Taking an intraday perspective, we study the dynamics of individual-level stock return volatility, measured by absolute 5-minute returns, and Twitter sentiment and activity. After accounting for the intraday periodicity in absolute returns, we discover some statistically significant co-movements of intraday volatility and information from stock-related Tweets for all constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, economically, the effects are of negligible magnitude and out-of-sample forecast performance is not improved when including Twitter sentiment and activity as exogenous variables. From a practical point of view, we find that high-frequency Twitter information is not particularly useful for highly active investors with access to such data for intraday volatility assessment and forecasting when considering individual-level stocks. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Forecasting; Intraday; Investor sentiment; Return volatility; Twitter";"Admati, A.R., Pfleiderer, P., A theory of intraday patterns: volume and price variability (1988) Rev.

Streaming data proves to be a perennial source of data analysis collected in real-time. Streaming data basically deals with the continuous flow of data which carries information from sources like websites, mobile phone applications, server logs, social websites, trading floors, etc. The major characteristics of such data being its accessibility and availability, help in proper analysis and prediction of user behavior in a ceaseless manner. The classifying model made out of historical data can be relentlessly honed to give even more accurate results since its outcome is always compared to the next tick of the clock. Spark streaming has been considered for the processing of humongous data and data ingestion tools like Twitter API and Apache Flume have been further implemented for analysis. © 2018 The Authors.

Zhang X., Shi J., Wang D., Fang B.;Exploiting investors social network for stock prediction in China's market;2018;Journal of Computational Science;18;Recent works have shown that social media platforms are able to influence the trends of stock price movements. However, existing works have major focused on the U.S. stock market and lacked attention to certain emerging countries such as China, where retail investors dominate the market. In this regard, as retail investors are prone to be influenced by news or other social media, psychological and behavioral features extracted from social media platforms are thought to well predict stock price movements in the China's market. Recent advances in the investor social network in China enables the extraction of such features from web-scale data. In this paper, on the basis of tweets from Xueqiu, a popular Chinese Twitter-like social platform specialized for investors, we analyze features with regard to collective sentiment and perception on stock relatedness and predict stock price movements by employing nonlinear models.

Batra R., Daudpota S.M.;Integrating StockTwits with sentiment analysis for better prediction of stock price movement;2018;2018 International Conference on Computing, Mathematics and Engineering Technologies: Invent, Innovate and Integrate for Socioeconomic Development, iCoMET 2018 - Proceedings;17;Sentiment Analysis is new way of machine learning to extract opinion orientation (positive, negative, neutral) from a text segment written for any product, organization, person or any other entity. Sentiment Analysis can be used to predict the mood of people that have impact on stock prices, therefore it can help in prediction of actual stock movement. In order to exploit the benefits of sentiment analysis in stock market industry we have performed sentiment analysis on tweets related to Apple products, which are extracted from StockTwits (a social networking site) from 2010 to 2017. Along with tweets, we have also used market index data which is extracted from Yahoo Finance for the same period. The sentiment score of a tweet is calculated by sentiment analysis of tweets through SVM. As a result each tweet is categorized as bullish or bearish. Then sentiment score and market data is used to build a SVM model to predict next day's stock movement. Results show that there is positive relation between people opinion and market data and proposed work has an accuracy of 76.65% in stock prediction. © 2018 IEEE.;"Machine Learning; NLP; Opinion Mining; Sentiment Analysis; Stock Prediction; StockTwits";"Fama, E.F., The behavior of stock-market prices (1965) The Journal of Business, pp. 34-105; Cootner, P.H., The random character of stock market The Journal of Business; Fama, E.F., Random walks in stock market prices Financial Analysts Journal; Fama, E.F., Fisher, L., Jensen, M.C., Roll, R., The adjustment of stock prices to new information International Economic Review; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science; Malcolm Baker, J.W., (2006) Investor Sentiment and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns; Megahed, F.M., Farmer, J., (2015) Frontiers in Statistical Quality Control, 11; Kordonis, J., Stock price forecasting via sentiment analysis on twitter (2016) The 20th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics (PCI '16), Greece; Dang, M., Improvement Methods for stock market prediction using financial news articles (2016) Information and Computer Science (NICS) 2016 3rd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference, Danang, Vietnam; Sun, A., Trade the tweet: Social media text mining and sparse matrix factorization for stock market prediction (2016) International Review of Financial Analysis, pp. 272-281; Meesad, P., Stock trend prediction relying on text mining and sentiment analysis with tweets (2014) Information and Communication Technologies (WICT) 2014, Bandar Hilir, Malaysia; Wenga, B., Ahmed, M.A., Megahedbc, F.M., Stock market one-day ahead movement prediction using disparate data sources (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, pp. 153-163; Smailovi, J., Grar, M., Lavra, N., Žnidarši, M., Predictive sentiment analysis of tweets: A stock market application (2013) Human-Computer Interaction and Knowledge Discovery in Complex, Unstructured, Big Data, pp. 77-88. , Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, Springer; Rao, T., Srivastava, S., Analyzing stock market movements using twitter sentiment analysis (2012) International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining; Gilbert, E., Karahalios, K., Widespread worry and the stock market (2010) Artifical Intelligence; Zhang, X., Fuehres, H., Gloor, P.A., (2009) Predicting Stock Market Indicators Through Twitter";2018 International Conference on Computing, Mathematics and Engineering Technologies, iCoMET 2018;Conference Paper
(Jeremy) Chiu C.-W., Harris R.D.F., Stoja E., Chin M.;Financial market Volatility, macroeconomic fundamentals and investor Sentiment;2018;Journal of Banking and Finance;14;In this paper, we investigate the dynamic relationship between financial market volatility, macroeconomic fundamentals and investor sentiment, employing a two-factor model to decompose volatility into a persistent long run component and a transitory short run component. Using a structural VAR model with Bayesian sign restrictions, we show that adverse shocks to aggregate demand and supply cause an increase in the persistent component of both stock and bond market volatility, and that adverse shocks to the persistent component of either stock or bond market volatility cause a deterioration in macroeconomic fundamentals. We find no evidence of a relationship between the transitory component of volatility and macroeconomic fundamentals. Instead, we find that the transitory component is more closely associated with changes in investor sentiment. Our results are robust to a wide range of alternative specifications. Out-of-sample forecasting shows that the components of volatility can improve forecasts of macroeconomic fundamentals, and vice versa. © 2018;"Bayesian estimation; Macroeconomic fundamentals; Stock and bond market volatility; Structural vector autoregression; Two-factor volatility model";"Adrian, T., Rosenberg, J., Stock returns and volatility: pricing the short-run and long-run components of market risk (2008) J.

Kelly S., Ahmad K.;Estimating the impact of domain-specific news sentiment on financial assets;2018;Knowledge-Based Systems;13;The influence of news on financial markets has been studied by extracting opinions and sentiment from text using content analysis and natural language processing techniques, and then using this measure to estimate the impact of sentiment on price changes. We present a method and implementation that analyses the content of news using multiple dictionaries that accounts for the specific use of terminology in a given domain. To evaluate our approach we build different collections of domain related news for two financial markets and examine the impact that topical news has on two financial benchmarks in the equity and oil markets. We examine how the level of news sentiment from different news sources influences financial returns over time. We create a trading signal based on the news impact that predicts next day returns in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and West Texas Intermediate crude oil. We find that incorporating news sentiment into a trading strategy increases annual returns over a simple buy and hold strategy for both markets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Domain terminology; Equity market; News sentiment; Oil commodities; Sentiment analysis; Trading strategy";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Vargas M.R., Dos Anjos C.E.M., Bichara G.L.G., Evsukoff A.G.;Deep Leaming for Stock Market Prediction Using Technical Indicators and Financial News Articles;2018;Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks;12;"This work uses deep learning models for daily directional movements prediction of a stock price using financial news titles and technical indicators as input. A comparison is made between two different sets of technical indicators, set 1: Stochastic %K, Stochastic %D, Momentum, Rate of change, William's %R, Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) oscillator and Disparity 5; set 2: Exponential Moving Average, Moving Average Convergence-Divergence, Relative Strength Index, On Balance Volume and Bollinger Bands. Deep learning methods can detect and analyze complex patterns and interactions in the data allowing a more precise trading process. Experiments has shown that Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be better than Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) on catching semantic from texts and RNN is better on catching the context information and modeling complex temporal characteristics for stock market forecasting. So, there are two models compared in this paper: A hybrid model composed by a CNN for the financial news and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for technical indicators, named as SI-RCNN; and a LSTM network only for technical indicators, named as I-RNN. The output of each model is used as input for a trading agent that buys stocks on the current day and sells the next day when the model predicts that the price is going up, otherwise the agent sells stocks on the current day and buys the next day. The proposed method shows a major role of financial news in stabilizing the results and almost no improvement when comparing different sets of technical indicators. © 2018 IEEE.";"Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Long Short-Term Memory; Recurrent neural network; Stocks forecasting";"Malkiel, B.G., (1973) A Random Walk Down Wall Street, , W.

Mahmoudi N., Docherty P., Moscato P.;Deep neural networks understand investors better;2018;Decision Support Systems;12;Studies that seek to examine the impact of sentiment in financial markets have been affected by inaccurate sentiment measurement and the use of inappropriate data. This study applies state-of-the-art techniques from the domain-general sentiment analysis literature to construct a more accurate decision support system that generates demonstrable improvement in investor sentiment classification performance compared with previous studies. The inclusion of emojis is shown significantly improve sentiment classification in traditional algorithms. Moreover, deep neural networks with domain-specific word embeddings outperform the traditional approaches for the classification of investor sentiment. The approach to sentiment classification outlined in this paper can be applied in future empirical tests that examine the impact of investor sentiment on financial markets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Deep neural network (DNN); Domain-specific; Emojis; Investor sentiment; StockTwits; Word embeddings";"Fama, E.F., Efficient capital markets: a review of theory and empirical work (1970) The Journal of Finance, 25 (2), pp. 383-417; Baker, M., Wurgler, J., The equity share in new issues and aggregate stock returns (2000) The Journal of Finance, 55 (5), pp. 2219-2257; Cochrane, J.H., New facts in finance (2000) Economic Perspectives.

Sohangir S., Petty N., Wang D.;Financial Sentiment Lexicon Analysis;2018;Proceedings - 12th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing, ICSC 2018;12;The modern stock market is a popular place to increase wealth and generate income, but the fundamental problem of when to buy or sell shares, or which stocks to buy has not been solved. With the availability of the Internet and its financial social networks, such as StockTwits and SeekingAlpha, investors around the world have new opportunities to gather and share their experiences. Individual experts can predict the movement of the stock market in financial social networks with reasonable accuracy, but how accurate is a large group of such experts in aggregate? One way to answer this question is by examining the sentiment of a massive group of these authors towards various stocks. By extracting the sentiment of the whole group, a collective prediction can be observed. Although sentiment extraction is a major technical challenge, the lexicon-based approach is an effective method of determining how positive or negative the content of a text document is. In this paper, we investigate if we can improve the performance of sentiment extraction from financial social media data by using lexicon-based approaches. © 2018 IEEE.;"natural language processing; opinion retrieval; Sentiment analysis; sentiment lexicon";"Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2, pp. 1-8. , March; Mittal, A., Goel, A., (2011) Stock Prediction Using Twitter Sentiment Analysis; Loughran, T., McDonald, B., When is a liability not a liability textual analysis, dictionaries, and 10-ks (2011) THE JOURNAL of FINANCE, 1 LXVI; Nadia Silva, E.H., Hruschka, E., Tweet sentiment analysis with classifier ensembles (2014) Journal of Computational Science, 66, pp. 170-179; Fersini, E.M.E., Pozzi, F., Automatic construction of financial semantic orientation lexicon from large scale Chinese news corpus (2014) Decision Support Systems, 68, pp. 26-38; Potts, C., Pearson, K., From frequency to meaning: Vector space models of semantics (2010) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 37, pp. 141-188; Wang, G., Wang, T., Wang, B., Sambasivan, D., Zhang, Z., Zheng, H., Zhao, B.Y., Crowds on wall street: Extracting value from collaborative investing platforms (2015) The 18th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW), , March; Bo Pang, L.L., Vaithyanathan, S., Thumbs up sentiment classification using machine learning techniques (2002) Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 66, pp. 79-86; Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Thumbs up or thumbs down semantic orientation applied to unsupervised classification of reviews (2002) Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 66, pp. 417-424; Liu, B., Sentiment analysis and subjectivity (2010) Handbook of Natural Language Processing, pp. 627-666. , Second Edition.

Hájek P.;Combining bag-of-words and sentiment features of annual reports to predict abnormal stock returns;2018;Neural Computing and Applications;12;Automated textual analysis of firm-related documents has become an important decision support tool for stock market investors. Previous studies tended to adopt either dictionary-based or machine learning approach. Nevertheless, little is known about their concurrent use. Here we use the combination of financial indicators, readability, sentiment categories, and bag-of-words (BoW) to increase prediction accuracy. This paper aims to extract both sentiment and BoW information from the annual reports of US firms. The sentiment analysis is based on two commonly used dictionaries, namely a general dictionary Diction 7.0 and a finance-specific dictionary proposed by Loughran and McDonald (J Finance 66:35–65, 2011. doi:10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01625.x). The BoW are selected according to their tf–idf. We combine these features with financial indicators to predict abnormal stock returns using a multilayer perceptron neural network with dropout regularization and rectified linear units. We show that this method performs similarly as naïve Bayes and outperforms other machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, C4.5 decision tree, and k-nearest neighbour classifier) in predicting positive/negative abnormal stock returns in terms of ROC. We also show that the quality of the prediction significantly increased when using the correlation-based feature selection of BoW. This prediction performance is robust to industry categorization and event window. © 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.;"Neural network; Prediction; Sentiment; Stock return; Text mining";"Loughran, T., Mcdonald, B., When is a liability not a liability?

Sun Y., Fang M., Wang X.;A novel stock recommendation system using Guba sentiment analysis;2018;Personal and Ubiquitous Computing;11;"Investment recommendation has been one of the hottest topics in the finance area which can help investors to get more profits and to avoid loss. Existing recommendation systems mostly depend on analysis of trading data and company profit prediction. Though many works show that there is a positive correlation between investors’ sentiment and the finance market trends, few recommendation theories have been built based on sentiment. The primary reason is the difficulty to measure investors’ sentiment. In this work, a novel stock recommendation system is developed based on a proposed theory concerning the correlation between Guba-based sentiment of the retail investors and the stock market trends in China. To verify four hypotheses of the theory, a novel method is proposed to measure the investors’ sentiment by exploiting the large volumes of emotion enriched texts posted in Guba, which is online social platform for individual investors to share news and opinions concerning their favorite stocks. Results show the correctness of the proposed theory: (1) there is a positive correlation between Guba-based sentiment and the stock market trends; 2) the higher the post volumes and agreement, more proficiency the bullishness would be; and (3) a long-lasting negative Guba-based sentiment indicates the arrival of the bear market. The proposed recommendation system consists of three criteria accordingly to ensure the portfolio to meet requirements of the theory. Finally, experiments are implemented using the real data of Chinese stock market from March 2009 to March 2016 and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed system in recommending lucrative stocks and the theoretical cumulate profit is about eight times of the CSI300 in the period. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.";;"Cho, V., (2010) MISMIS - a Comprehensive Decision Support System for Stock Market Investment, , Elsevier Science Publishers B.

Wang Q., Xu W., Zheng H.;Combining the wisdom of crowds and technical analysis for financial market prediction using deep random subspace ensembles;2018;Neurocomputing;10;Many researchers and practitioners have attempted to predict financial market trends for excess returns using multiple information sources including social media. Recent studies have investigated the relation between public sentiment and stock price movements and demonstrated that investment decisions are affected by public opinion. In this paper, we design a novel framework that combines the wisdom of crowds and technical analysis for financial market prediction using a new fusion strategy. A machine learning technique called deep random subspace ensembles (DRSE), which integrates deep learning algorithms and ensemble learning methods, is proposed according to the characteristics of the prediction task. Based on collected real-world datasets, the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline models in predicting stock market by at least 14.2% in terms of AUC value, indicating the efficacy of DRSE as a viable mechanism for financial market prediction. © 2018;"Deep learning; Financial market prediction; Random subspace ensembles; Sentiment analysis; Wisdom of crowds";"Alan, Y., Gao, G.P., Gaur, V., Does inventory productivity predict future stock returns? a retailing industry perspective (2014) Manag.

Matsubara T., Akita R., Uehara K.;Stock price prediction by deep neural generative model of news articles;2018;IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems;10;"In this study, we propose a deep neural generative model for predicting daily stock price movements given news articles. Approaches involving conventional technical analysis have been investigated to identify certain patterns in past price movements, which in turn helps to predict future price movements. However, the financial market is highly sensitive to specific events, including corporate buyouts, product releases, and the like. Therefore, recent research has focused on modeling relationships between these events that appear in the news articles and future price movements; however, a very large number of news articles are published daily, each article containing rich information, which results in overfitting to past price movements used for parameter adjustment. Given the above, we propose a model based on a generative model of news articles that includes price movement as a condition, thereby avoiding excessive overfitting thanks to the nature of the generative model. We evaluate our proposed model using historical price movements of Nikkei 225 and Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, confirming that our model predicts future price movements better than such conventional classifiers as support vector machines and multilayer perceptrons. Further, our proposed model extracts significant words from news articles that are directly related to future stock price movements.

Alkubaisi G.A.A.J., Kamaruddin S.S., Husni H.;Conceptual framework for stock market classification model using sentiment analysis on twitter based on Hybrid Naïve Bayes Classifiers;2018;International Journal of Engineering and Technology(UAE);10;Sentiment analysis has gained a lot of importance in last decade especially on the availability of data from Twitter that has created more interest for research in this field. Nevertheless, stock market classification models still suffer less accuracy and this has affected negatively the stock market indicators. In this paper, a new framework related to sentiment analysis from Twitter posts is proposed. The proposed framework represents an improved design of classification model that works to improve the classification accuracy to support decision makers in the domain of stock market exchange. This model starts with data collection part and in second phase filtration is done on data to get only the relevant data. The most important phase is the labelling part in which polarity of data is determined and negative, positive or neutral values are assigned to statements of people. The fourth part is the classification phase in which suitable patterns of stock market will be identified by hybridizing NBCs. The last phase is performance and evaluation. This study proposes to a Hybrid Naïve Bayes Classifiers (HNBCs) as a machine learning method for stock market classification, hence represents a useful study for investors, companies and researchers and will help them to formulate their policies according to sentiments of people. © 2018 Authors.;"Classification accuracy;

Kraaijeveld O., De Smedt J.;The predictive power of public Twitter sentiment for forecasting cryptocurrency prices;2020;Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money;8;Cryptocurrencies have become a very popular topic recently, primarily due to their disruptive potential and reports of unprecedented returns. In addition, academics increasingly acknowledge the predictive power of Twitter for a wide variety of events and more specifically for financial markets. This paper studies to what extent public Twitter sentiment can be used to predict price returns for the nine largest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar and TRON. By using a cryptocurrency-specific lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach, financial data and bilateral Granger-causality testing, it was found that Twitter sentiment has predictive power for the returns of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Using a bullishness ratio, predictive power is found for EOS and TRON. Finally, a heuristic approach is developed to discover that at least 1–14% of the obtained Tweets were posted by Twitter “bot” accounts. This paper is the first to cover the predictive power of Twitter sentiment in the setting of multiple cryptocurrencies and to explore the presence of cryptocurrency-related Twitter bots. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;"Bots; Cryptocurrencies; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment analysis; Time series analysis; Twitter";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is All That Talk Just Noise?

Li X., Shang W., Wang S.;Text-based crude oil price forecasting: A deep learning approach;2019;International Journal of Forecasting;20;This study proposes a new, novel crude oil price forecasting method based on online media text mining, with the aim of capturing the more immediate market antecedents of price fluctuations. Specifically, this is an early attempt to apply deep learning techniques to crude oil forecasting, and to extract hidden patterns within online news media using a convolutional neural network (CNN). While the news-text sentiment features and the features extracted by the CNN model reveal significant relationships with the price change, they need to be grouped according to their topics in the price forecasting in order to obtain a greater forecasting accuracy. This study further proposes a feature grouping method based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model for distinguishing effects from various online news topics. Optimized input variable combination is constructed using lag order selection and feature selection methods. Our empirical results suggest that the proposed topic-sentiment synthesis forecasting models perform better than the older benchmark models. In addition, text features and financial features are shown to be complementary in producing more accurate crude oil price forecasts. © 2018 The Authors;"Convolutional neural network; Financial markets; Oil price forecasting; Online news; Text analysis";"Abdel-Hamid, O., Mohamed, A.R., Jiang, H., Penn, G., (2012), Applying convolutional neural networks concepts to hybrid NN-HMM model for speech recognition.

Narayan P.K.;Can stale oil price news predict stock returns?;2019;Energy Economics;20;"We hand-collect time-series data on positive and negative oil price news from 100 news sources from around the world, covering 59,129 news articles on oil prices. Using time-series predictive regression models estimated for 45 countries, we show that: (a) positive and negative news predict stock returns for at most 12 countries for which the oil price does not predict returns; and (b) together the three oil price measures predict returns for at most 23/45 countries. Therefore, oil price news turns out to be more powerful in predicting returns in a horserace with oil price. We show that the ability of oil to predict returns is through the discount rate and cash flow channels. Our results survive a battery of robustness tests. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.";"Oil price news; Predictive regression; Stock returns; Time-series";"Bai, J., Perron, P., Estimating and testing linear models with multiple structural changes (1998) Econometrica, 66, pp. 47-78; Campbell, J., Shiller, R., The dividend-price ratio and expectations of future dividends and discount factors (1988) Rev.

Calomiris C.W., Mamaysky H.;How news and its context drive risk and returns around the world;2019;Journal of Financial Economics;15;We develop a classification methodology for the context and content of news articles to predict risk and return in stock markets in 51 developed and emerging economies. A parsimonious summary of news, including topic-specific sentiment, frequency, and unusualness (entropy) of word flow, predicts future country-level returns, volatilities, and drawdowns. Economic and statistical significance are high and larger for year ahead than monthly predictions. The effect of news measures on market outcomes differs by country type and over time. News stories about emerging markets contain more incremental information. Out-of-sample testing confirms the economic value of our approach for forecasting country-level market outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;"Empirical asset pricing; Financial news media; International markets; Natural language processing";"Ang, A., Bekaert, G., Stock return predictability: is it there?

Sheng J., Lan H.;Business failure and mass media: An analysis of media exposure in the context of delisting event;2019;Journal of Business Research;10;It is understood that the mass media are a pervasive force in shaping the public's perceptions. This paper incorporates agenda-setting theory to explore whether and to what extent that the mass media can signal business failure. In an analysis of news coverage relating to Chinese underperforming listed firms over the period 2006–2017, it is demonstrated that firms whose stocks are put under “special treatment” status due to consecutive annual losses experience (*ST) greater news volume and lower news sentiment relative to other firms in the quarter in which the “delisting risk warning” announcements are made. Furthermore, *ST firms which are eventually delisted have a greater volume of news than other *ST firms, but we find no evidence that the sentiment of news relates to termination of listing. Our findings offer insights into the informativeness of the mass media and their agenda-setting effects in the business failure context. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;"Agenda-setting; Business failure; Delisting; Mass media; Media exposure; Sentiment analysis";"Amankwah-Amoah, J., An integrative process model of organisational failure (2016) Journal of Business Research, 69 (9), pp. 3388-3397; Ball-Rokeach, S.J., DeFleur, M.L., A dependency model of mass-media effects (1976) Communication Research, 3 (1), pp. 3-21; Baumol, W.J., Entrepreneurship: Productive, unproductive, and destructive (1996) Journal of Business Venturing, 11 (1), pp. 3-22; Berlo, D.K., The process of communication (1960), Holt, Rinehart, Winston New York; Boyle, E.H., Hoeschen, A., Theorizing the form of media coverage over time (2001) The Sociological Quarterly, 42 (4), pp. 511-527; Bradshaw, M.T., Analysts' forecasts: What do we know after decades of work?

Czudaj R.L.;Crude oil futures trading and uncertainty;2019;Energy Economics;9;This paper examines the effect of different dimensions of uncertainty on expectations of WTI crude oil futures momentum traders at a daily level. We consider two concepts of uncertainty and two momentum trading indicators based on technical analysis. In addition, we also use wavelet techniques to decompose crude oil futures prices into different frequencies accounting for investors' sentiment at various horizons. To allow for different effects on the propagation mechanism of uncertainty shocks, we apply a time-varying Bayesian VAR approach. Our findings indicate that both measures of uncertainty affect momentum trading on the crude oil futures market in several periods, especially during the great recession between 2007 and 2009. For the decomposed futures prices our results also show that the reaction to uncertainty differs substantially across frequencies. High frequencies exhibit a very short-lived reaction to uncertainty while low frequencies show a persistent reaction to uncertainty shocks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;"Crude oil futures; Technical analysis; Time-varying Bayesian VAR; Uncertainty; Wavelets";"Antonakakis, N., Chatziantoniou, I., Filis, G., Dynamic spillovers of oil price shocks and economic policy uncertainty (2014) Energy Econ., 44, pp. 433-447; Appel, G., Technical Analysis: Power Tools for Active Investors Upper Saddle River (2009), FT Press New Jersey; Bachmann, R., Elstner, S., Sims, E.R., Uncertainty and economic activity: evidence from business survey data (2013) Am.

Yasir M., Durrani M.Y., Afzal S., Maqsood M., Aadil F., Mehmood I., Rho S.;An intelligent event-sentiment-based daily foreign exchange rate forecasting system;2019;Applied Sciences (Switzerland);7;Financial time series analysis is an important research area that can predict various economic indicators such as the foreign currency exchange rate. In this paper, a deep-learning-based model is proposed to forecast the foreign exchange rate. Since the currency market is volatile and susceptible to ongoing social and political events, the proposed model incorporates event sentiments to accurately predict the exchange rate. Moreover, as the currency market is heavily dependent upon highly volatile factors such as gold and crude oil prices, we considered these sensitive factors for exchange rate forecasting. The validity of the model is tested over three currency exchange rates, which are Pak Rupee to US dollar (PKR/USD), British pound sterling to US dollar (GBP/USD), and Hong Kong Dollar to US dollar (HKD/USD). The study also shows the importance of incorporating investor sentiment of local and foreign macro-level events for accurate forecasting of the exchange rate. We processed approximately 5.9 million tweets to extract major events' sentiment. The results show that this deep-learning-based model is a better predictor of foreign currency exchange rate in comparison with statistical techniques normally employed for prediction. The results present evidence that the exchange rate of all the three countries is more exposed to events happening in the US. © 2019 by the authors.;"Deep learning; Event sentiment; Forecasting; Foreign exchange rate; Regression; SVM";"Meese, R.A., Rogoff, K., Empirical exchange rate models of the seventies: Do they fit out of sample?

Xing F.Z., Cambria E., Welsch R.E.;Intelligent asset allocation via market sentiment views;2018;IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine;27;The sentiment index of market participants has been extensively used for stock market prediction in recent years. Many financial information vendors also provide it as a service. However, utilizing market sentiment under the asset allocation framework has been rarely discussed. In this article, we investigate the role of market sentiment in an asset allocation problem. We propose to compute sentiment time series from social media with the help of sentiment analysis and text mining techniques. A novel neural network design, built upon an ensemble of evolving clustering and long short-term memory, is used to formalize sentiment information into market views. These views are later integrated into modern portfolio theory through a Bayesian approach. We analyze the performance of this asset allocation model from many aspects, such as stability of portfolios, computing of sentiment time series, and profitability in our simulations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms some of the most successful forecasting techniques. Thanks to the introduction of the evolving clustering method, the estimation accuracy of market views is significantly improved. © 2018 IEEE.;;"Li, Q., Jiang, L., Li, P., Chen, H., Tensor-based learning for predicting stock movements (2015) Proc. 29th Conf.

Elshendy M., Fronzetti Colladon A., Battistoni E., Gloor P.A.;Using four different online media sources to forecast the crude oil price;2018;Journal of Information Science;15;"This study looks for signals of economic awareness on online social media and tests their significance in economic predictions. The study analyses, over a period of 2 years, the relationship between the West Texas Intermediate daily crude oil price and multiple predictors extracted from Twitter; Google Trends;Wikipedia; and the Global Data on Events, Location and Tone (GDELT) database. Semantic analysis is applied to study the sentiment, emotionality and complexity of the language used. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variable (ARIMAX) models are used to make predictions and to confirm the value of the study variables. Results show that the combined analysis of the four media platforms carries valuable information in making financial forecasting. Twitter language complexity, GDELT number of articles andWikipedia page reads have the highest predictive power. This study also allows a comparison of the different fore-sighting abilities of each platform, in terms of how many days ahead a platform can predict a price movement before it happens. In comparison with previous work, more media sources and more dimensions of the interaction and of the language used are combined in a joint analysis. © The Author(s) 2017.";"Financial forecast; Global data on events; Google trends; Location and tone; Oil price; Twitter; Wikipedia";"Surowiecki, J., (2005) The wisdom of crowds, , New York: Anchor Books; Asur, S., Huberman, B.A., Predicting the future with social media (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE/WIC/ACM international conference on web intelligence and intelligent agent technology, pp. 492-499. , Toronto, ON, Canada, 31 August-3 September, New York: IEEE; Kaplan, A.M., Haenlein, M., Users of the world, unite!

Malandri L., Xing F.Z., Orsenigo C., Vercellis C., Cambria E.;Public Mood–Driven Asset Allocation: the Importance of Financial Sentiment in Portfolio Management;2018;Cognitive Computation;14;The study of the impact of investor sentiment on stock returns has gained increasing momentum in the past few years. It has been widely accepted that public mood is correlated with financial markets. However, only a few studies discussed how the public mood would affect one of the fundamental problems of computational finance: portfolio management. In this study, we use public financial sentiment and historical prices collected from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to train multiple machine learning models for automatic wealth allocation across a set of assets. Unlike previous studies which set as target variable the asset prices in the portfolio, the variable to predict here is represented by the best asset allocation strategy ex post. Experiments performed on five portfolios show that long short-term memory networks are superior to multi-layer perceptron and random forests producing, in the period under analysis, an average increase in the revenue across the portfolios ranging between 5% (without financial mood) and 19% (with financial mood) compared to the equal-weighted portfolio. Results show that our all-in-one and end-to-end approach for automatic portfolio selection outperforms the equal-weighted portfolio. Moreover, when using long short-term memory networks, the employment of sentiment data in addition to lagged data leads to greater returns for all the five portfolios under evaluation. Finally, we find that among the employed machine learning algorithms, long short-term memory networks are better suited for learning the impact of public mood on financial time series. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;"Long short-term memory networks; Machine learning; Portfolio allocation; Sentiment analysis";"Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) J Comput Sci, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Howard, N., Cambria, E., Intention awareness: improving upon situation awareness in human-centric environments (2013) Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 3 (1), p. 9; Nassirtoussi, A.K., Aghabozorgi, S., Wah, T.Y., Chek, D., Ngo, L., Text mining for market prediction A systematic review (2014) Expert Syst Appl, 41 (16), pp. 7653-7670; Fama, E.F., The behavior of stock-market prices (1965) J Bus, 38 (1), pp. 34-105; Black, F., Noise (1986) J Finance, 41 (3), pp. 528-543; Bradford De Long, J., Shleifer, A., Summers, L.H., Waldmann, R.J., Noise trader risk in financial markets (1990) J Political Econ, 98 (4), pp. 703-738; Kavussanos, M.G., Dockery, E., A multivariate test for stock market efficiency: the case of ase (2001) Appl Financ Econ, 11 (5), pp. 573-579; Bo, Q., Rasheed, K., Stock market prediction with multiple classifiers (2007) Appl Intell, 26 (1), pp. 25-33; Fama, E.F., Efficient capital markets: a review of theory and empirical work (1970) J Finance, 25 (2), pp. 383-417; Li, Q., Jiang, L., Li, P., Chen, H., Tensor-based learning for predicting stock movements (2015) AAAI, pp. 1784-1790; Gregory, W., Brown and Michael T Cliff.

Sun T., Wang J., Zhang P., Cao Y., Liu B., Wang D.;Predicting Stock Price Returns Using Microblog Sentiment for Chinese Stock Market;2017;Proceedings - 2017 3rd International Conference on Big Data Computing and Communications, BigCom 2017;16;Recently there have been many efforts to study the predictability of stock market trend using post sentiments on social media sites. These studies have mainly focused on US stock market. In this paper we investigate the relationship between stock price movement and social media sentiment in China, which has a large stock capitalization and a unique social media landscape. We collect data from several different types of social media sites (microblogs, chat rooms, web forums), and find that data from these sites exhibit distinct characteristics in activity level, post length, and correlation with stock market behavior. Users in stock market related chat rooms tend to post more but much shorter blogs. The activity level is much more highly correlated with market trading hours and stock trading volumes. We then investigated several machine learning models to classify post sentiment in chat rooms, and achieved a performance similar to the state-of-the-art sentiment analysis result for short posts. We find that there is strong correlation and Granger causality between chat room post sentiment and stock price movement, indicating that post sentiments can be used to improve the prediction of stock price return over using the historic stock trading information alone. We further propose a prediction model that uses chat room sentiment to forecast the market direction, and develop a trading strategy that utilizes the prediction as trading indicators. Backtest using our strategy achieves promising portfolio returns. A total return of 19.54% is obtained at the end of the seven-month period when taking into account of slippage and commissions, compared to a loss of -25.26% by a passive buy-and-hold baseline strategy. © 2017 IEEE.;"Microblog; Sentiment Analysis; Stock Market Prediction";"Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2010) CoRR, , vol. abs/1010.3003; Mao, Y., Wei, W., Wang, B., Liu, B., Correlating s&p 500 stocks with twitter data (2012) Proceedings of the First ACM International Workshop on Hot Topics on Interdisciplinary Social Networks Research, pp. 69-72; Rechenthin, M., Street, W.N., Srinivasan, P., Stock chatter: Using stock sentiment to predict price direction (2013) Algorithmic Finance, 2 (3-4), pp. 169-196; Si, J., Mukherjee, A., Liu, B., Pan, S.J., Li, Q., Li, H., Exploiting social relations and sentiment for stock prediction (2014) EMNLP, 14, pp. 1139-1145; Ranco, G., Bordino, I., Bormetti, G., Caldarelli, G., Lillo, F., Treccani, M., Coupling news sentiment with web browsing data improves prediction of intra-day price dynamics (2016) PLoS ONE; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise? the information content of internet stock message boards (2004) Journal of Finance, 59 (3), pp. 1259-1294; Zhang, W., Skiena, S., Trading strategies to exploit blog and news sentiment (2010) Fourth Int.

In this paper, we implement a model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to predict the stock volatility in the Chinese stock market. We also propose many price related features which are used as inputs for our model. Apart from that, we carefully select official accounts from Chinese largest online social networks-Sina Weibo and extract the content posted by these accounts to analyze the public moods. An influence feature is derived based on the public moods to further improve the prediction model.

Li B., Chan K.C.C., Ou C., Ruifeng S.;Discovering public sentiment in social media for predicting stock movement of publicly listed companies;2017;Information Systems;29;The popularity of many social media sites has prompted both academic and practical research on the possibility of mining social media data for the analysis of public sentiment. Studies have suggested that public emotions shown through Twitter could be well correlated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, it remains unclear how public sentiment, as reflected on social media, can be used to predict stock price movement of a particular publicly-listed company. In this study, we attempt to fill this research void by proposing a technique, called SMeDA-SA, to mine Twitter data for sentiment analysis and then predict the stock movement of specific listed companies. For the purpose of experimentation, we collected 200 million tweets that mentioned one or more of 30 companies that were listed in NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange. SMeDA-SA performs its task by first extracting ambiguous textual messages from these tweets to create a list of words that reflects public sentiment. SMeDA-SA then made use of a data mining algorithm to expand the word list by adding emotional phrases so as to better classify sentiments in the tweets. With SMeDA-SA, we discover that the stock movement of many companies can be predicted rather accurately with an average accuracy over 70%. This paper describes how SMeDA-SA can be used to mine social media date for sentiments. It also presents the key implications of our study. © 2017;"Big data; Data mining; Parallel architecture; Sentiment analysis; SMeDA-SA; Social media analysis; Stock prediction; Twitter";"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter; Cheng, L., Raymond, C.W., Viral marketing for dedicated customers?

Two sets of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock data and corresponding social media data from Yahoo! Finance stock message boards are used in a comprehensive empirical study. Some key findings are: (a) Affirmative response to the above question; (b) Models with only social media sentiments and market returns perform at least as well as models that include Fama-French and Momentum factors; (c) There are significant correlations between stocks, ranging from −0.8 to 0.6 in both data sets. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.";"Bayesian inference; Dynamic Linear Models; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Seemingly Unrelated Regressions; Social media sentiments";"Ando, T., Zellner, A., Hierarchical Bayesian analysis of the seemingly unrelated regression and simultaneous equations models using a combination of direct Monte Carlo and importance sampling techniques (2010) Bayesian Anal., 5 (1), pp. 65-96; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Li J., Bu H., Wu J.;Sentiment-aware stock market prediction: A deep learning method;2017;14th International Conference on Services Systems and Services Management, ICSSSM 2017 - Proceedings;31;Stock market prediction has attracted much attention from academia as well as business. However, it is a challenging research topic, in which many advanced computational methods have been proposed, but not yet attained a desirable and reliable performance. This study proposes a new method for stock market prediction, which adopts the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and incorporates investor sentiment and market factors to improve forecasting performance. By extracting investor sentiment from forum posts using Naïve Bayes, this paper makes it possible to analyze the irrational component of stock price. Our empirical study on CSI300 index proves that our prediction method provides better prediction performance. It gives a prediction accuracy of 87.86%, outperforming other benchmark models by at least 6%. Furthermore, our empirical study reveals evidence that helps to better understand investor sentiment and stock behaviors. Finally, this work shows the potential of deep learning financial time series in the presence of strong noises. © 2017 IEEE.;"Deep learning; Investor sentiment; Stock market prediction";"Fama, E.F., The adjustment of stock prices to new information (1969) International Economic Review, 10 (1), pp. 1-21; Fama, E.F., Efficient capital markets: II (1991) The Journal of Finance, 46 (5), pp. 1575-1617; Cootner, P.H., (1964) The Random Character of Stock Market Prices; Fama, E.F., The behavior of stock-market prices (1965) The Journal of Business, 38 (1), pp. 34-105; Qian, B., Rasheed, K., Stock market prediction with multiple classifiers (2007) Applied Intelligence, 26 (1), pp. 25-33; Malkiel, B.G., The efficient market hypothesis and its critics (2003) The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 17 (1), pp. 59-82; Robert, R.J.P., (2002) The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior and the New Science of Socionomics, , New Classics Library, GA; Prechter, R.R., Jr., Parker, W.D., The financial/economic dichotomy in social behavioral dynamics: The socionomic perspective (2007) The Journal of Behavioral Finance, 8 (2), pp. 84-108; Smith, V.L., Constructivist and ecological rationality in economics (2003) The American Economic Review, 93 (3), pp. 465-508; Nofsinger, J.R., Social mood and financial economics (2005) The Journal of Behavioral Finance, 6 (3), pp. 144-160; Butler, K.C., Jamal Malaikah, S., Efficiency and inefficiency in thinly traded stock markets: Kuwait and Saudi Arabia (1992) Journal of Banking & Finance, 16 (1), pp. 197-210; Kavussanos, M.G., Dockery, E., A multivariate test for stock market efficiency: The case of ASE (2001) Applied Financial Economics, 11 (5), pp. 573-579; Gallagher, L.A., Taylor, M.P., Permanent and temporary components of stock prices: Evidence from assessing macroeconomic shocks (2002) Southern Economic Journal, pp. 345-362; De Long, J.B., Noise trader risk in financial markets (1990) Journal of Political Economy, 98 (4), pp. 703-738; Shleifer, A., Vishny, R.W., The limits of arbitrage (1997) The Journal of Finance, 52 (1), pp. 35-55; Li, F., (2006) Do Stock Market Investors Understand the Risk Sentiment of Corporate Annual Reports?; Schumaker, R.P., Evaluating sentiment in financial news articles (2012) Decision Support Systems, 53 (3), pp. 458-464; Tetlock, P.C., Giving content to investor sentiment: The role of media in the stock market (2007) The Journal of Finance, 62 (3), pp. 1139-1168; Tetlock, P.C., Saar-Tsechansky, M., Macskassy, S., More than words: Quantifying language to measure firms' fundamentals (2008) The Journal of Finance, 63 (3), pp. 1437-1467; Chen, H., Customers as advisors: The role of social media in financial (2012) Management Science, 54 (3), pp. 477-491; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Bujari A., Furini M., Laina N.;On using cashtags to predict companies stock trends;2017;2017 14th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, CCNC 2017;17;"Different theories state that future market values strongly depend on psychological and financial factors: when investors feel positive moods they invest and the value of the stock market increases; conversely, when they feel negative moods they do not invest and the value of the stock market decreases. Today, researchers are trying to exploit the data publicly available in social media and, in particular, different researches showed a connection between Twitter messages and the stock market index. In this paper, we do not focus on a generic stock market index, now we focus on the sole sentiment analysis. Instead, our goal is to investigate whether tweet messages can be used to predict the future trend (e.g., positive, negative or neutral) of the stocks of specific companies listed in the Dow Jones stock market. In particular, we focus on companies belonging to three different economic sectors (technology, service and health-care) and we consider the trend of 5 different metrics for each stock (e.g., highest, lowest, opening price, etc.) and the trend of 13 different variables of the tweets (e.g., volume, sentiment, tweets with links, etc.). Through an evaluation that employed more than 800,000 tweets, we show that some of the proposed ad-hoc prediction methods well predict (i.e., up to 82% of success) the next day trend of the stock values of specific companies. © 2017 IEEE.";;"Bollen, J., Mao, H., Twitter mood as a stock market predictor (2011) Computer, 44 (10), pp. 91-94. , Oct; Makrehchi, M., Shah, S., Liao, W., Stock prediction using eventbased sentiment analysis (2013) Proc. of the Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technologies Confernce, 1, pp. 337-342. , Nov; Bujari, A., Palazzi, C.E., Aircache: A crowd-based solution for geoanchored floating data (2016) Mobile Information Systems, 2016; Palazzi, C.E., Bujari, A., Social-aware delay tolerant networking for mobile-to-mobile file sharing (2012) International Journal of Communication Systems, 25 (10), pp. 1281-1299; Ferretti, S., Furini, M., Palazzi, C.E., Roccetti, M., Salomoni, P., Www recycling for a better world (2010) Commun.

Checkley M.S., Higón D.A., Alles H.;The hasty wisdom of the mob: How market sentiment predicts stock market behavior;2017;Expert Systems with Applications;19;We explore the ability of sentiment metrics, extracted from micro-blogging sites, to predict stock markets. We also address sentiments’ predictive time-horizons. The data concern bloggers’ feelings about five major stocks. Taking independent bullish and bearish sentiment metrics, granular to two minute intervals, we model their ability to forecast stock price direction, volatility, and traded volume. We find evidence of a causal link from sentiments to stock price returns, volatility and volume. The predictive time-horizon is minutes, rather than hours or days. We argue that diverse and high volume sentiment is more predictive of price volatility and traded volume than near-consensus is predictive of price direction. Causality is ephemeral. In this sense, the crowd is more a hasty mob than a source of wisdom. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;"Analytics; Forecasting; Micro-blogging; Sentiment; Social media; Stock market";"Andersen, T., Bollerslev, T., Diebold, F., Roughing it up: Including jump components in the measurement, modeling and forecasting of return volatility (2007) Review of Economics and Statistics, 89, pp. 701-720; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Khedr A.E., Salama S.E., Yaseen N.;Predicting stock market behavior using data mining technique and news sentiment analysis;2017;International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications;28;Stock market prediction has become an attractive investigation topic due to its important role in economy and beneficial offers. There is an imminent need to uncover the stock market future behavior in order to avoid investment risks. The large amount of data generated by the stock market is considered a treasure of knowledge for investors. This study aims at constructing an effective model to predict stock market future trends with small error ratio and improve the accuracy of prediction. This prediction model is based on sentiment analysis of financial news and historical stock market prices. This model provides better accuracy results than all previous studies by considering multiple types of news related to market and company with historical stock prices. A dataset containing stock prices from three companies is used. The first step is to analyze news sentiment to get the text polarity using naïve Bayes algorithm. This step achieved prediction accuracy results ranging from 72.73% to 86.21%. The second step combines news polarities and historical stock prices together to predict future stock prices. This improved the prediction accuracy up to 89.80%.;"Data mining; News sentiment analysis; Sentiment analysis; Stock market; Text mining";"Wyss, B.O., (2000) Fundamentals of the stock market, p. 245; Jiawei Han, M.K., (2006) Data MiningConcepts and Techniques, , Second Edi.

Bharathi S., Geetha A.;Sentiment analysis for effective stock market prediction;2017;International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems;15;The Stock market forecasters focus on developing a successful approach to predict stock prices. The vital idea to successful stock market prediction is not only achieving best results but also to minimize the inaccurate forecast of stock prices. This paper attempts to design and implement a predictive system for guiding stock market investment. The novelty of our approach is the combination of both sensex points and Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds for effective prediction. Our claim is that the sentiment analysis of RSS news feeds has an impact on stock market values. Hence RSS news feed data are collected along with the stock market investment data for a period of time. Using our algorithm for sentiment analysis, the correlation between the stock market values and sentiments in RSS news feeds are established. This trained model is used for prediction of stock market rates. In our experimental study the stock market prices and RSS news feeds are collected for the company ARBK from Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). Our experimental study has shown an improvement of 14.43% accuracy prediction, when compared with the standard algorithm of ID3, C4.5 and moving average stock level indicator.;"RSS Feeds; Sensex points; Sentiment mining; Stock data analysis; Stock market intelligence";"Balahur, A., MijailKabadjov, C., Steinberger, J., Steinberger, R., Montoyo, A., ""Challenges and Solutions in the Opinion Summarization"" (2012) Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, Springer, 39 (2), pp. 375-398; Li, Q., Chen, Y., Jiang, L.L., Li, P., Chen, H., ""A Tensor-Based Information Framework for Predicting the Stock Market"" (2016) ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 34 (2), pp. 1-30; Nguyen, D., Le, M., ""A Two-Stage Architecture for Stock Price forecasting by combining SOM and fuzzy-SVM"" (2014) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 12 (8), pp. 1-6; Johan, B., Mao, H., Zeng, X., "" Twitter Mood Predicts The Stock Market"" (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Kunhuang, H., Yu, T.H.K., ""The Application of Neural Networks to Forecast Fuzzy Time Series"" (2006) Physical A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications"", 363 (2), pp. 481-491; Karamibekr, M., Ghorbani, A.A., ""Sentence Subjectivity Analysis in Social Domains"" (2013) In: Proc. of IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conf.

Wang F., Zhang Y., Rao Q., Li K., Zhang H.;Exploring mutual information-based sentimental analysis with kernel-based extreme learning machine for stock prediction;2017;Soft Computing;26;"Stock price volatility prediction is regarded as one of the most attractive and meaningful research issues in financial market. Some existing researches have pointed out that both the prediction accuracy and the prediction speed are the most important factors in the process of stock prediction. In this paper, we focus on the problem of how to design a methodology which can improve prediction accuracy as well as speed up prediction process, and propose a new prediction model which employs mutual information- based sentimental analysis methodology with extreme learning machine to enhance the prediction performance. The two major contributions of our work are (1) as the words in the news documents are not absolutely negative or positive, and the lengths of the financial news documents are various; here, we propose a new sentimental analysis methodology based on mutual information to improve the efficiency of feature selection, which is different from the traditional sentimental analysis algorithm, and a new weighting scheme is also used in the feature weighting process; (2) since ELM is a fast learning model and has been successfully applied in many research fields, we propose a prediction model which combined mutual information-based sentimental analysis with kernel-based ELM named as MISA-K-ELM. This model has the benefits of both statistical sentimental analysis and ELM, which can well balance the requirements of both prediction accuracy and prediction speed. We take experiments on HKEx 2001 stock market datasets to validate the performance of the proposed MISA-K-ELM. The market historical price and the market news are implemented in our MISA-K-ELM. To test the efficiency of MISA, we first compare the prediction accuracy of ELM model using MISA with ELM model using traditional sentimental analysis. Then, we compare our proposed MISA-K-ELM with existing state-of-the-art learning algorithms, such as Back-Propagation Neural Network (BP-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our experimental results show that (1) MISA model can help get higher prediction accuracy than traditional sentimental analysis models; (2) MISA-K-ELM and MISA-SVM have a higher prediction accuracy than MISA-BP-NN and MISA-B-ELM; (3) both MISA-K-ELM and MISA-B-ELM can achieve faster prediction speed than MISA-SVM and MISA-BP-NN in most cases; (4) in most cases, MISA-K-ELM has higher prediction accuracy than the other three methodologies. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.";"Extreme learning machine; Mutual information; Optimization; Sentimental analysis; Stock prediction";"Aizawa, A., An information-theoretic perspective of tf-idf measures (2003) Inf Process Manag, 39 (1), pp. 45-65; Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., Sentiwordnet 3.0: an enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2010) LREC, 10 (2010), pp. 2200-2204; Bautin, M., Vijayarenu, L., Skiena S (2008) International sentiment analysis for news and blogs, p. 2008. , In, ICWSM; arXiv:1007.0085; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) J Comput Sci, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Cheung, C.-C., Ng, S.-C., Lui, A.K., Xu, S.S., Enhanced two-phase method in fast learning algorithms (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 international joint conference on neural networks (IJCNN’10), IEEE, 2010, pp. 1-7; Chum, O., Philbin, J., Zisserman, A., Near duplicate image detection: min-hash and tf-idf weighting (2008) BMVC, 810 (2008), pp. 812-815; Dai, W., Wu, J.-Y., Lu, C.-J., Combining nonlinear independent component analysis and neural network for the prediction of asian stock market indexes (2012) Exp Syst Appl, 39 (4), pp. 4444-4452; Deng, S., Mitsubuchi, T., Shioda, K., Shimada, T., Sakurai, A., Combining technical analysis with sentiment analysis for stock price prediction (2011) Dependable, autonomic and secure computing (DASC), 2011 IEEE 9th international conference on, IEEE, 2011, pp. 800-807; Feldman, R., Rosenfeld, B., Bar-Haim, R., Fresko M (2011) The stock sonarłsentiment analysis of stocks based on a hybrid approach (2011) 23rd IAAI Conference; Feng, G., Huang, G.-B., Lin, Q., Gay, R.K.L., Error minimized extreme learning machine with growth of hidden nodes and incremental learning (2009) IEEE Trans Neural Netw, 20 (8), pp. 1352-1357; Handoko, S.D., Keong, K.C., Soon, O.Y., Zhang, G.L., Brusic, V., Extreme learning machine for predicting hla-peptide binding (2006) Advances in neural networks-ISNN.

Oliveira N., Cortez P., Areal N.;The impact of microblogging data for stock market prediction: Using Twitter to predict returns, volatility, trading volume and survey sentiment indices;2017;Expert Systems with Applications;111;In this paper, we propose a robust methodology to assess the value of microblogging data to forecast stock market variables: returns, volatility and trading volume of diverse indices and portfolios. The methodology uses sentiment and attention indicators extracted from microblogs (a large Twitter dataset is adopted) and survey indices (AAII and II, USMC and Sentix), diverse forms to daily aggregate these indicators, usage of a Kalman Filter to merge microblog and survey sources, a realistic rolling windows evaluation, several Machine Learning methods and the Diebold-Mariano test to validate if the sentiment and attention based predictions are valuable when compared with an autoregressive baseline. We found that Twitter sentiment and posting volume were relevant for the forecasting of returns of S&P 500 index, portfolios of lower market capitalization and some industries. Additionally, KF sentiment was informative for the forecasting of returns. Moreover, Twitter and KF sentiment indicators were useful for the prediction of some survey sentiment indicators. These results confirm the usefulness of microblogging data for financial expert systems, allowing to predict stock market behavior and providing a valuable alternative for existing survey measures with advantages (e.g., fast and cheap creation, daily frequency). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd;"Data and text mining; Regression; Stock market; Twitter";"Al Nasseri, A., Tucker, A., de Cesare, S., Quantifying stocktwits semantic terms’ trading behavior in financial markets: An effective application of decision tree algorithms (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, 42 (23), pp. 9192-9210; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Gao B., Yang C.;Forecasting stock index futures returns with mixed-frequency sentiment;2017;International Review of Economics and Finance;18;Using the data in Chinese financial market, mixed-frequency stock index futures sentiment and mixed-frequency stock index sentiment are constructed according to MIDAS model. We test whether mixed-frequency stock index futures sentiment and mixed-frequency stock index sentiment have predictive power on stock index futures returns. The empirical results show that mixed-frequency stock index futures sentiment factors have more predictive power than mixed-frequency stock index sentiment factors and Fama-French three factors. In out-sample forecast, we show that sentiment trading strategy provides a more positive returns than time series momentum trading strategy and passive long positions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;"MIDAS model;

Zhang G., Xu L., Xue Y.;Model and forecast stock market behavior integrating investor sentiment analysis and transaction data;2017;Cluster Computing;13;Social network media analytics is showing promise for prediction of financial markets. However, the true value of such data is unclear due to a lack of consensus on which instruments can be predicted. In this paper, we investigate whether measurements of collective emotional states derived from large scale network feeds are correlated to the stock transaction data over time. The information space corresponding to stocks is divided into the network public opinion space Opinion_Space and the realistic transaction space Behavior_Space. We then handle the information and generate the multidimensional time series from them respectively. Furthermore, Granger causality analysis and information theory measures are used to find and demonstrate that social media sentiments contain statistically significant ex-ante information on the future prices. At last, we propose our separate-LSTM model and the experimental results of six stocks which are randomly selected indicate that financial data predictions can be significantly improved through our model by the fusion of network public opinion emotions and realistic transaction data. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;"Emotions; Granger causality; LSTM; Network public opinion; Predictive analysis; Stock transaction; Time dependence";"Kietzmann, J.H., Hermkens, K., McCarthy, I.P., Silvestre, B.S., Social media?

Heston S.L., Ranjan Sinha N.;News vs. sentiment: Predicting stock returns from news stories;2017;Financial Analysts Journal;34;The authors used a dataset of more than 900,000 news stories to test whether news can predict stock returns. They measured sentiment with a proprietary Thomson Reuters neural network and found that daily news predicts stock returns for only one to two days, confirming previous research. Weekly news, however, predicts stock returns for one quarter. Positive news stories increase stock returns quickly, but negative stories receive a long-delayed reac-tion. Much of the delayed response to news occurs around the subse-quent earnings announcement.;;"Akbas, F., Boehmer, E., Erturk, B., Sorescu, S.M., (2013) Short Interest, Returns, and Fundamentals, , Working paper (August; Altman, E.I., Marco, G., Varetto, F., Corporate distress diagnosis: Comparisons using linear discriminant analysis and neural networks (the Italian Experience) (1994) Journal of Banking & Finance, 18 (3), pp. 505-529. , May; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is All That Talk Just Noise? the Information Content of Internet Stock Message Boards (2004) Journal of Finance, 59 (3), pp. 1259-1294. , June; Atiya, A.F., Bankruptcy prediction for credit risk using neural networks: A survey and new results (2001) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 12 (4), pp. 929-935. , July; Bernard, V.L., Thomas, J.K., Evidence that stock prices do not fully reflect the implications of current earnings for future earnings (1990) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 13 (4), pp. 305-340. , December; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8. , March; Boudoukh, J., Feldman, R., Kogan, S., Richardson, M., (2013) Which News Moves Stock Prices?

The prediction model uses different attributes as an input and predicts market as Positive & Negative. The attributes used in the model includes Oil rates, Gold & Silver rates, Interest rate, Foreign Exchange (FEX) rate, NEWS and social media feed. The old statistical techniques including Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) are also used as input. The machine learning techniques including Single Layer Perceptron (SLP), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are compared. All these attributes are studied separately also. The algorithm MLP performed best as compared to other techniques. The oil rate attribute was found to be most relevant to market performance. The results suggest that performance of KSE-100 index can be predicted with machine learning techniques. © 2016 IEEE.;"KSE-100 Index; Neural Networks; Stock Prediction; Support Vector Machine";"Qamar, S., Adil, S.H., Comparative analysis of data mining techniques for financial data using parallel processing (2009) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology; Adil, S.H., Qamar, S., Implementation of association rule mining using CUDA (2009) International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET); Ah, S.S.A., Moinuddin, M., Raza, K., Adil, S.H., An adaptive learning rate for RBFNN using time-domain feedback analysis (2014) The Scientific World Journal; Lo, A.W., MacKinlay, A.C., Stock market prices do not follow random walks: Evidence from a simple specification test (1988) Review of Financial Studies, 1 (1), pp. 41-66; Aurangzeb, C.D.R., Factors affecting performance of stock market: Evidence from South Asian countries (2012) International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences, 2 (9); Fatima, S., Hussain, G., Statistical models of KSE100 index using hybrid financial systems (2008) Neurocomputing, 71 (13), pp. 2742-2746; Ali, I., Rehman, K.U., Yilmaz, A.K., Khan, M.A., Afzal, H., Causal relationship between macro-economic indicators and stock exchange prices in Pakistan (2010) African Journal of Business Management, 4 (3), p. 312; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Shen, S., Jiang, H., Zhang, T., (2012) Stock Market Forecasting Using Machine Learning Algorithms; Asur, S., Huberman, B.A., Predicting the future with social media (2010) International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT); Hung, N.H., Zhaojun, Y., Profitability of applying simple moving average trading rules for the Vietnamese stock market (2013) Journal of Business Management, 2 (3), pp. 22-31; Wilson, T., Hoffmann, P., Somasundaran, S., Kessler, J., Wiebe, J., Choi, Y., Patwardhan, S., OpinionFinder: A system for subjectivity analysis (2005) Proceedings of Emnlp on Interactive Demonstrations, pp. 34-35";3rd International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences, ICCOINS 2016;Conference Paper
Sun A., Lachanski M., Fabozzi F.J.;Trade the tweet: Social media text mining and sparse matrix factorization for stock market prediction;2016;International Review of Financial Analysis;38;We investigate the potential use of textual information from user-generated microblogs to predict the stock market. Utilizing the latent space model proposed by Wong et al. (2014), we correlate the movements of both stock prices and social media content. This study differs from models in prior studies in two significant ways: (1) it leverages market information contained in high-volume social media data rather than news articles and (2) it does not evaluate sentiment. We test this model on data spanning from 2011 to 2015 on a majority of stocks listed in the S&P 500 Index and find that our model outperforms a baseline regression. We conclude by providing a trading strategy that produces an attractive annual return and Sharpe ratio. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;"Social media text mining; Sparse matrix factorization; Stock market prediction; Tweets";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Day M.-Y., Lee C.-C.;Deep learning for financial sentiment analysis on finance news providers;2016;Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, ASONAM 2016;32;Investors have always been interested in stock price forecasting. Since the development of electronic media, hundreds pieces of financial news are released on different media every day. Numerous studies have attempted to examine whether the stock price forecasting through text mining technology and machine learning could lead to abnormal returns. However, few of them involved the discussion on whether using different media could affect forecasting results. Financial sentiment analysis is an important research area of financial technology (FinTech). This research focuses on investigating the influence of using different financial resources to investment and how to improve the accuracy of forecasting through deep learning.

Dang M., Duong D.;Improvement methods for stock market prediction using financial news articles;2016;NICS 2016 - Proceedings of 2016 3rd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science;16;News articles serve the purpose of spreading company's information to the investors either consciously or unconsciously in their trading strategies on the stock market. Because of the immense growth of the internet in the last decade, the amount of financial articles have experienced a significant growth. It is important to analyze the information as fast as possible so they can support the investors in making the smart trading decisions before the market has had time to adjust itself to the effect of the information. This paper proposes an approach of using time series analysis and improved text mining techniques to predict daily stock market directions. Experiment results show that our system achieved high accuracy (up to 73%) in predicting the stock trends. © 2016 IEEE.;"Prediction; Stock market; SVM; Text mining";"Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Dien, D., Kiem, H., Vietnamese word segmentation (2001) NLPRS, 1, pp. 749-756; Duong, D., Nguyen, T., Dang, M., Stock market prediction using financial news articles on ho chi minh stock exchange (2016) Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication, pp. 71-76. , ACM; Fan, R.-E., Chang, K.-W., Hsieh, C.-J., Wang, X.-R., Lin, C.-J., Liblinear: A library for large linear classification (2008) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 9, pp. 1871-1874; Gao, Y., Zhou, L., Zhang, Y., Xing, C., Sun, Y., Zhu, X., Sentiment classification for stock news (2010) Pervasive Computing and Applications (ICPCA), 2010 5th Int Conference on, pp. 99-104. , IEEE; Gidofalvi, G., Elkan, C., Using news articles to predict stock price movements (2001) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, , University of California, San Diego; Huyen, N.T.M., Roussanaly, A., Vinh, H.T., Al, E., A hybrid approach to word segmentation of Vietnamese texts (2008) Language and Automata Theory and Applications, pp. 240-249. , Springer; Kaya, M.Y., Karsligil, M.E., Stock price prediction using financial news articles (2010) Information and Financial Engineering (ICIFE), 2010 2nd IEEE Int Conference on, pp. 478-482. , IEEE; Lauren, S., Harlili, S.D., Stock trend prediction using simple moving average supported by news classification (2014) Advanced Informatics: Concept, Theory and Application (ICAICTA), 2014 International Conference of, pp. 135-139. , IEEE; Le-Hong, P., Roussanaly, A., Nguyen, T.M.H., Rossignol, M., An empirical study of maximum entropy approach for part-of-speech tagging of Vietnamese texts (2010) Traitement Automatique des Langues Naturelles-TALN 2010, p. 12; Lewis, D.D., Feature selection and feature extraction for text categorization (1992) Proceedings of the Workshop on Speech and Natural Language, pp. 212-217. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Martineau, J., Finin, T., Delta tfidf: An improved feature space for sentiment analysis (2009) ICWSM; Meesad, P., Li, J., Stock trend prediction relying on text mining and sentiment analysis with tweets (2014) Int and Communication Technologies (WICT), 2014 Fourth World Congress on, pp. 257-262. , IEEE; Sebastiani, F., Machine learning in automated text categorization (2002) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 34 (1), pp. 1-47; Sirohi, A.K., Mahato, P.K., Multiple kernel learning for stock price direction prediction (2014) Advances in Engineering and Technology Research (ICAETR), 2014 Int Conference, pp. 1-4. , IEEE; Yan, J., Liu, N., Zhang, B., Yan, S., Chen, Z., Cheng, Q., Fan, W., Ma, W.-Y., Ocfs: Optimal orthogonal centroid feature selection for text categorization (2005) Proceedings of the 28th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 122-129. , ACM";3rd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science, NICS 2016;Conference Paper
Naifar N.;Do global risk factors and macroeconomic conditions affect global Islamic index dynamics? A quantile regression approach;2016;Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance;44;The aim of this paper is to explain global Dow Jones Islamic Market Index (DJIMI) dynamics across quantiles during the period of January 2003 to October 2014. Using quantile regression approach, we investigate the co-movement and the dependence structure between DJIMI returns and influential global financial market conditions, macroeconomic indicators and risk factors (major conventional stock market indices returns, global stock market uncertainty (VIX), crude oil prices, inflation rates, slope of the yield curves, investor sentiment indicator, and global sovereign credit risk represented by sovereign credit default swap (CDS) premiums). The empirical results demonstrate that conventional stock market returns, stock market implied volatility and the slope of the yield curve (as a proxy for future economic conditions) are significant for all the quantiles and display asymmetric tail dependence. During and after the global financial crisis, the sovereign credit risk factor has also been significant with positive coefficients, implying the impact of systemic nature of sovereign credit risk on explaining DJIMI returns. Moreover, the impact of oil prices and investor sentiment indicator is positive and significant but only for the lower quantiles. © 2015 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois;"Credit default swap; Global financial crisis; Implied volatility; Investor sentiment; Islamic indices; Sovereign credit risk";"Aloui, C., Hammoudeh, S., Ben Hamida, H., Global factors driving structural changes in the co-movement between Sharia stocks and sukuk in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (2015) The North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 31, pp. 311-329; Abugri, B.A., Empirical relationship between macroeconomic volatility and stock returns: Evidence from Latin American markets (2008) International Review of Financial Analysis, 17 (2008), pp. 396-410; Albaity, M., Mudor, H., Return performance, cointegration and short run dynamics of Islamic and non-Islamic indices: Evidence from the U.S. and Malaysia during the subprime crisis (2012) Atlantic Review of Economics, 1, pp. 1-22; Al-Khazali, O., Lean, H.H., Samet, A., Do Islamic stock indexes outperform conventional stock indexes?.

Cakra Y.E., Distiawan Trisedya B.;Stock price prediction using linear regression based on sentiment analysis;2016;ICACSIS 2015 - 2015 International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems, Proceedings;34;Stock price prediction is a difficult task, since it very depending on the demand of the stock, and there is no certain variable that can precisely predict the demand of one stock each day. However, Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) said that stock price also depends on new information significantly. One of many information sources is people's opinion in social media. People's opinion about products from certain companies may determine the company's reputation and thus affecting people's decision to buy the stock of the company. When using opinion as primary data, it is necessary to make a suitable analysis of it. A famous example using opinion as data is sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is a process to determine emotion/feeling within people opinion about something, in this case products of some companies. There are some researches about sentiment analysis used to predict the stock prices. Bollen on his research concludes that people opinion on social media such as Twitter can predict DJIA value with 87.6% accuracy. This shows that there is a relation between sentiment analysis and stock prices. Our purpose on this research is to predict the Indonesian stock market using simple sentiment analysis. Naive Bayes and Random Forest algorithm are used to classify tweet to calculate sentiment regarding a company. The results of sentiment analysis are used to predict the company stock price. We use linear regression method to build the prediction model. Our experiment shows that prediction models using previous stock price and hybrid feature as predictor gives the best prediction with 0.9989 and 0.9983 coefficient of determination. © 2015 IEEE.;"linear regression; sentiment analysis; stock price; supervised learning; Twitter";"Efficient Market Hypothesis: Is the Stock Market Efficient?, , http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/022004.asp, Investopedia.

Li Q., Chen Y., Jiang L.L., Li P., Chen H.;A Tensor-Based Information Framework for Predicting the Stock Market;2016;ACM Transactions on Information Systems;27;To study the influence of information on the behavior of stock markets, a common strategy in previous studies has been to concatenate the features of various information sources into one compound feature vector, a procedure thatmakes it more difficult to distinguish the effects of different information sources.We maintain that capturing the intrinsic relations among multiple information sources is important for predicting stock trends. The challenge lies in modeling the complex space of various sources and types of information and studying the effects of this information on stock market behavior. For this purpose, we introduce a tensorbased information framework to predict stock movements. Specifically, our framework models the complex investor information environment with tensors. A global dimensionality-reduction algorithm is used to capture the links among various information sources in a tensor, and a sequence of tensors is used to represent information gathered over time. Finally, a tensor-based predictive model to forecast stock movements, which is in essence a high-order tensor regression learning problem, is presented. Experiments performed on an entire year of data for China Securities Index stocks demonstrate that a trading system based on our framework outperforms the classic Top-N trading strategy and two state-of-the-art media-aware trading.;"News; Predictive model; Social media; Stock; Tensor; Trading strategy";"Avery, C., Zemsky, P., Multidimensional uncertainty and herd behavior in financial markets (1998) American Economic Review, 1998, pp. 724-748; Baeza-Yates, R., Ribeiro-Neto, B., (1999) Modern Information Retrieval, pp. 41-44. , Addison Wesley Longman Publisher 1999; Bellman, R., Dynamic programming and lagrange multiplier s (1956) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 42, p. 767. , National Academy of Sciences; Bellman, R.E., Dreyfus, S.E., (1962) Applied Dynamic Programming, , Rand Corporation; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8. , 2011; Cai, D., He, X., Wen, J.-R., Han, J., Ma, W.-Y., (2006) Support Tensor Machines for Text Categorization, , Report No. UIUCDCS-R-2006-2714 2006); Catanzaro, B., Sundaram, N., Keutzer, K., Fast support vector machine training and classification on graphics processors (2008) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 104-111. , ACM; Chan, W.S., Stock price reaction to news and no-news: Drift and reversal after headlines (2003) Journal of Financial Economics, 70 (2), pp. 223-260. , 2003; Cheung, Y.-W., Ng, L.K., Stock price dynamics and firm size: An empirical investigation (1992) Journal of Finance, 47 (5), pp. 1985-1997. , 1992; Chung, F.R.K., (1997) Spectral Graph Theory, 92. , American Mathematical Society; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Cucchiara, R., Grana, C., Piccardi, M., Prati, A., Detecting moving objects, ghosts, and shadows in video streams (2003) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 25 (10), pp. 1337-1342. , 2003; Dechow, P.M., Accounting earnings and cash flows as measures of firm performance: The role of accounting accruals (1994) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 18 (1), pp. 3-42. , 1994; Edwards, R.D., Magee, J., Bassetti, W.H.C., (2012) Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, , CRC Press; Fama, E.F., The behavior of stock-market prices (1965) Journal of Business, 38 (1), pp. 34-105. , 1965; Fama, E.F., French, K.R., Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds (1993) Journal of Financial Economics, 33 (1), pp. 3-56. , 1993; Fleury, A., Vacher, M., Noury, N., SVM -based multimodal classification of activities of daily living in health smart homes: Sensors algorithms, and first experimental results (2010) IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine, 14 (2), pp. 274-283. , 2010; Francis, J., Hanna, J.D., Philbrick, D.R., Management communications with securities analysts (1997) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 24 (3), pp. 363-394. , 1997; Frank, M.Z., Antweiler, W., Is all that talk just noise?

Nayak A., Pai M.M.M., Pai R.M.;Prediction Models for Indian Stock Market;2016;Procedia Computer Science;21;Stock market price data is generated in huge volume and it changes every second. Stock market is a complex and challenging system where people will either gain money or lose their entire life savings. In this work, an attempt is made for prediction of stock market trend. Two models are built one for daily prediction and the other one is for monthly prediction. Supervised machine learning algorithms are used to build the models. As part of the daily prediction model, historical prices are combined with sentiments. Up to 70% of accuracy is observed using supervised machine learning algorithms on daily prediction model. Monthly prediction model tries to evaluate whether there is any similarity between any two months trend. Evaluation proves that trend of one month is least correlated with the trend of another month. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Nguyen T.H., Shirai K., Velcin J.;Sentiment analysis on social media for stock movement prediction;2015;Expert Systems with Applications;191;The goal of this research is to build a model to predict stock price movement using the sentiment from social media. Unlike previous approaches where the overall moods or sentiments are considered, the sentiments of the specific topics of the company are incorporated into the stock prediction model. Topics and related sentiments are automatically extracted from the texts in a message board by using our proposed method as well as existing topic models. In addition, this paper shows an evaluation of the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis in the stock prediction task via a large scale experiment. Comparing the accuracy average over 18 stocks in one year transaction, our method achieved 2.07% better performance than the model using historical prices only. Furthermore, when comparing the methods only for the stocks that are difficult to predict, our method achieved 9.83% better accuracy than historical price method, and 3.03% better than human sentiment method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Gunduz H., Cataltepe Z.;Borsa Istanbul (BIST) daily prediction using financial news and balanced feature selection;2015;Expert Systems with Applications;20;In this paper, a novel method is proposed to predict the direction of Borsa Istanbul (BIST) 100 Index (BIST100) open prices using the news articles released, as well as the price data, from the day before. Although English news articles have been used for market-prediction before, to the best of our knowledge, Turkish news articles together with prices have not yet been used to predict the Turkish markets. Turkish text mining techniques are applied on news articles to form feature vectors for each trading day. The feature vectors are assigned three labels based on the direction of the price change from the closing price of the day before and whether the change is significant. News articles are represented using high dimensional features, some of which could be noisy or irrelevant for prediction. There is also the scarcity of training data. Therefore, this study incorporates feature selection methods to select features that could improve classification performance. By its nature, significant positive or negative changes in stock price happen much less than non-significant changes, resulting in an imbalanced data set. Most feature selection methods in literature aim to reduce the classification accuracy. However, for imbalanced datasets, other measures, such as macro-averaged F-measure need to be considered. The paper proposes a feature selection methods that is able to deal with the class imbalance problem through oversampling of the minority classes and consideration of an ensemble of selected features. In order to decide on importance of features, as the relevance criterion for each feature, the proposed methodology uses mutual information which can detect nonlinear dependencies between variables. Therefore, the proposed feature selection method is called Balanced Mutual Information (BMI) feature selection method. Experiments were performed based on news articles provided by two different news sources: Public Disclosure Platform of BIST and financial news websites. It was shown that, using Balanced Mutual Information feature selection method, the significant changes in the BIST100 Index were predicted with an accuracy of 0.74 and a macro-averaged F-measure of 0.68. The BMI feature selection method was compared with Mutual Information and Chi-square based feature selection methods and it was found out that BMI method results in higher performance using a smaller number of features. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nofer M., Hinz O.;Using Twitter to Predict the Stock Market: Where is the Mood Effect?;2015;Business and Information Systems Engineering;47;Behavioral finance researchers have shown that the stock market can be driven by emotions of market participants. In a number of recent studies mood levels have been extracted from Social Media applications in order to predict stock returns. The paper tries to replicate these findings by measuring the mood states on Twitter. The sample consists of roughly 100 million tweets that were published in Germany between January, 2011 and November, 2013. In a first analysis, a significant relationship between aggregate Twitter mood states and the stock market is not found. However, further analyses also consider mood contagion by integrating the number of Twitter followers into the analysis. The results show that it is necessary to take into account the spread of mood states among Internet users. Based on the results in the training period, a trading strategy for the German stock market is created. The portfolio increases by up to 36 % within a six-month period after the consideration of transaction costs. © 2015 Springer Fachmedien.;"Forecasting; Mood analysis; Social media; Stock market; Twitter";"Ali, K., Pazzani, M., Reducing the small disjuncts problem by learning probabilistic concept descriptions (1992) Computational Learning Theory and Natural Learning Systems, 3. , T.

Li Q., Jiang L., Li P., Chen H.;Tensor-based learning for predicting stock movements;2015;Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence;20;Stock movements are essentially driven by new information. Market data, financial news, and social sentiment are believed to have impacts on stock markets. To study the correlation between information and stock movements, previous works typically concatenate the features of different information sources into one super feature vector. However, such concatenated vector approaches treat each information source separately and ignore their interactions. In this article, we model the multi-faceted investors' information and their intrinsic links with tensors. To identify the nonlinear patterns between stock movements and new information, we propose a supervised tensor regression learning approach to investigate the joint impact of different information sources on stock markets. Experiments on CSI 100 stocks in the year 2011 show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art trading strategies. © Copyright 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Liu L., Wu J., Li P., Li Q.;A social-media-based approach to predicting stock comovement;2015;Expert Systems with Applications;34;"Stock return comovement analysis is important to financial analysts, decision makers, and academic researchers and has many financial implications, such as portfolio management, style investing, and market risk detecting. This paper proposes a novel model to both identify homogeneous stock groups and predict stock comovement with respect to firm-specific social media metrics. One of the innovations of the social media platform is that it breaks traditional media intermediation. A firm with an official Twitter account can publish information and interact with its users directly. Such direct information is largely reflected on firm-specific metrics, e.g.; the firm's number of followers and number of tweets sent. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to reveal the impact of social media metrics on stock return comovement studies. By analyzing samples from the NYSE and NASDAQ stock exchanges, we find that firms with official Twitter accounts have a much higher comovement than those without such accounts. Furthermore, we classify the former set of firms into homogeneous groups by their specific microblogging metrics. The results demonstrate that these metrics cannot only predict the comovement of stocks but also notably increase the accuracy of comovement predicting, compared with industry categories. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.";"Comovement; Industry classification; Microblogging; Social media";"Aghabozorgi, S., Teh, Y.W., Stock market co-movement assessment using a three-phase clustering method (2014) Expert Systems with Applications, 41 (4), pp. 1301-1314; Alexander, R.M., Gentry, J.K., Using social media to report financial results (2014) Business Horizons, 57 (2), pp. 161-167; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise? the information content of internet stock message boards (2004) The Journal of Finance, 59 (3), pp. 1259-1294; Aral, S., Dellarocas, C., Godes, D., Introduction to the special issue-social media and business transformation: A framework for research (2013) Information Systems Research, 24 (1), pp. 3-13; Baker, M., Wurgler, J., Investor sentiment and the cross-section of stock returns (2006) The Journal of Finance LXI, (4), pp. 1645-1680; Barberis, N., Shleifer, A., Style investing (2003) Journal of Financial Economics, 68, pp. 161-199; Barberis, N., Shleifer, A., Wurgler, J., Comovement (2005) Journal of Financial Economics, 75, pp. 283-317; Bhojraj, S., Lee, C.M.C., Oler, D.K., What's my line?

Empowered by recent research on the automated mining of business networks, this article illustrates the design of a novel business network-based model called the energy cascading model (ECM) for predicting directional stock price movements of related firms. More specifically, the proposed network-based predictive analytics model considers both influential business relationships and Twitter sentiments to infer a firm's middle to long-term directional stock price movements. The reported empirical experiments are based on a publicly available financial corpus and social media postings that reveal the proposed ECM model to be effective for predicting directional stock price movements. It outperforms the best baseline model, the Pearson correlation-based prediction model, in upward stock price movement prediction by 11.7 percent in terms of F-measure. © 2001-2011 IEEE.;"business network mining; intelligent systems; network-based inference; predictive analytics; stock movement prediction; Twitter sentiments";"Gnyawali, D.R., Madhavan, R., Cooperative Networks and Competitive Dynamics: A Structural Embeddedness Perspective (2001) Academy of Management Rev., 26 (3), pp. 431-446; Brandenburger, A.M., Nalebuff, B.J., (1997) Co-Opetition, , Doubleday; Lau, R.Y.K., Web 2.0 Environmental Scanning and Adaptive Decision Support for Business Merger and Acquisition (2012) MIS Quarterly, 36 (4), pp. 1239-1268; Nair, H.S., Manchanda, P., Bhatia, T., Asymmetric Social Interactions in Physician Prescription Behavior: The Role of Opinion Leaders (2010) J.

A new feature which captures topics and their sentiments simultaneously is introduced in the prediction model. In addition, a new topic model TSLDA is proposed to obtain this feature. Our method outperformed a model using only historical prices by about 6.07% in accuracy. Furthermore, when comparing to other sentiment analysis methods, the accuracy of our method was also better than LDA and JST based methods by 6.43% and 6.07%. The results show that incorporation of the sentiment information from social media can help to improve the stock prediction. © 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics.;;"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise? the information content of internet stock message boards (2004) The Journal of Finance, 59 (3), pp. 1259-1294; Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., Sentiwordnet 3.0: An enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2011) Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on International Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC10, 10, pp. 2200-2204; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Fama, E.F., Fisher, L., Jensen, M.C., Roll, R., The adjustment of stock prices to new information (1969) International Economic Review, 10 (1), pp. 1-21; Fama, E.F., Efficient capital markets: II (1991) The Journal of Finance, 46 (5), pp. 1575-1617; Jo, Y., Oh, A.H., Aspect and sentiment unification model for online review analysis (2011) Proceedings of the Fourth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, pp. 815-824. , ACM; Joachims, T., (1998) Text Categorization with Support Vector Machines: Learning with Many Relevant Features, , Springer; Lakkaraju, H., Bhattacharyya, C., Bhattacharya, I., Merugu, S., Exploiting coherence for the simultaneous discovery of latent facets and associated sentiments (2011) Proceedings of the Eleventh SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, pp. 498-509. , SDM 2011, April 28-30, 2011, Mesa, Arizona, USA.

Luss R., D’Aspremont A.;Predicting abnormal returns from news using text classification;2015;Quantitative Finance;53;We show how text from news articles can be used to predict intraday price movements of financial assets using support vector machines. Multiple kernel learning is used to combine equity returns with text as predictive features to increase classification performance and we develop an analytic center cutting plane method to solve the kernel learning problem efficiently. We observe that while the direction of returns is not predictable using either text or returns, their size is, with text features producing significantly better performance than historical returns alone. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.;"Forecasting applications; Optimization; Pattern recognition; Statistical learning theory; Text classification";"Andersen, T.G., Bollerslev, T., Intraday periodicity and volatility persistence in financial markets (1997) J.

Bhardwaj A., Narayan Y., Vanraj, Pawan, Dutta M.;Sentiment Analysis for Indian Stock Market Prediction Using Sensex and Nifty;2015;Procedia Computer Science;30;From the last twenty years, the application of Internet based technologies had brought a significant impact on the Indian stock market. Use of the Internet has eliminated the barriers of brokers and geographical location because now investors can buy and sell their shares by accessing the stock market status from anywhere at any time. Before investing money, it is very important for investors to predict the stock market. In today's digital world Internet based technologies such as Cloud Computing, Big Data analytics, and Sentiment analysis have changed the way we do business. Sentiment analysis or opinion mining makes use of text mining, natural language processing (NLP), in order to identify and extract the subjective content by analyzing user's opinion, evaluation, sentiments, attitudes and emotions. In this research work importance of sentiment analysis for stock market indicators such as Sensex and Nifty has been done to predict the price of stock. Finally, we draw conclusions and provide suggestions for future work. © 2015 The Authors.;"Indian stock market; Nifty; Opinion mining; Sensex; Sentiment analysis";"Sun, B., Ng, V.T., (2014) Analyzing Sentimental Influence of Posts on Social Networks IEEE International Conference on Computer Supported Work in Design, pp. 546-551;

Kim S.-H., Kim D.;Investor sentiment from internet message postings and the predictability of stock returns;2014;Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization;77;By using an extensive dataset of more than 32 million messages on 91 firms posted on the Yahoo! Finance message board over the period January 2005 to December 2010, we examine whether investor sentiment as expressed in posted messages has predictive power for stock returns, volatility, and trading volume. In intertemporal and cross-sectional regression analyses, we find no evidence that investor sentiment forecasts future stock returns either at the aggregate or at the individual firm level. Rather, we find evidence that investor sentiment is positively affected by prior stock price performance. We also find no significant evidence that investor sentiment from Internet postings has predictive power for volatility and trading volume. A distinctive feature of our study is the use of sentiment information explicitly revealed by retail investors as well as classified by a machine learning classification algorithm and a much longer sample period relative to prior studies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;"Internet posting messages; Investor sentiment; Return predictability; Text classification; Trading volume; Volatility";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Nuij W., Milea V., Hogenboom F., Frasincar F., Kaymak U.;An automated framework for incorporating news into stock trading strategies;2014;IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering;39;In this paper we present a framework for automatic exploitation of news in stock trading strategies. Events are extracted from news messages presented in free text without annotations. We test the introduced framework by deriving trading strategies based on technical indicators and impacts of the extracted events. The strategies take the form of rules that combine technical trading indicators with a news variable, and are revealed through the use of genetic programming.

We then employ a labeled topic model to jointly model both the tweets and the network structure to assign each node and each edge a topic respectively. This Semantic Stock Network (SSN) summarizes discussion topics about stocks and stock relations. We further show that social sentiment about stock (node) topics and stock relationship (edge) topics are predictive of each stock's market. For prediction, we propose to regress the topic-sentiment time-series and the stock's price time series. Experimental results demonstrate that topic sentiments from close neighbors are able to help improve the prediction of a stock markedly. © 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics.";;"Baldwin, T., Cook, P., Han, B., Harwood, A., Karunasekera, S., Moshtaghi, M., A support platform for event detection using social intelligence (2012) Proceedings of the Demonstrations at the 13th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL '12), pp. 69-72. , Association for Computational Linguistics, Stroudsburg, PA, USA; Bishop, C.M., (2006) Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, , Springer; Blei, D., Ng, A., Jordan, M., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X.J., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computer Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Bonanno, G., Lillo, F., Mantegna, R.N., High frequency cross-correlation in a set of stocks (2001) Quantitative Finance, Taylor and Francis Journals, 1 (1), pp. 96-104; Cohen, J., Cohen, P., West, S.G., Aiken, L.S., (2003) Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , (3rd ed.)

Geva T., Zahavi J.;Empirical evaluation of an automated intraday stock recommendation system incorporating both market data and textual news;2014;Decision Support Systems;64;"In this study we evaluate the effectiveness of augmenting numerical market data with textual-news data, using data mining methods, for forecasting stock returns in intraday trading. Integrating these two sources of data not only enriches the information available for the forecasting model, but it can potentially capture joint patterns that may not otherwise be identified when each data source is employed separately. We start with market data and then gradually add various textual data representations, going from simple representations, such as word counts, to more advanced representations involving sentiment analysis. To find the incremental value of each data representation, we build an end-to-end recommendation process including data preprocessing, modeling, validation, trade recommendations and economic evaluation. Each component of the modeling process is optimized to remove human bias and to allow us to impartially compare the results of the various models. Additionally, we experiment with several forecasting algorithms to find the one that yields the ""best"" results according to a variety of performance criteria. We employ data representation procedures and modeling improvements beyond those used in previous related studies. The economic evaluation of the results is conducted using a simulation procedure that inherently accounts for transaction costs and eliminates biases that have potentially affected previous related data-mining studies. This research is one of the largest-scale data-mining studies for evaluating the effectiveness of integrating market data with textual news data for the purpose of stock investment recommendations. The results of our study are promising in that they show that augmenting market data with advanced textual data representation significantly improves stock purchase decisions. Best results are achieved when the approach is implemented with a nonlinear neural network forecasting algorithm. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.";"Data-mining; Investment decisions; Prediction; Recommendation; Stock returns";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Studies have suggested that public emotions shown through Tweeter may well be correlated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, can public sentiment be analyzed to predict the movements of the stock price of a particular company? If so, is it possible for the stock price of one company to be more predictable than that of another company? Is there a particular kind of companies whose stock price are more predictable based on analyzing public sentiments as reflected in Twitter data? In this article, we propose a method to mine Twitter data for answers to these questions. Specifically, we propose to use a data mining algorithm to determine if the price of a selection of 30 companies listed in NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange can actually be predicted by the given 15 million records of tweets (i.e., Twitter messages). We do so by extracting ambiguous textual tweet data through NLP techniques to define public sentiment, then make use of a data mining technique to discover patterns between public sentiment and real stock price movements. With the proposed algorithm, we manage to discover that it is possible for the stock closing price of some companies to be predicted with an average accuracy as high as 76.12%. In this paper, we describe the data mining algorithm that we use and discuss the key findings in relation to the questions posed. © 2014 IEEE.;"data mining; social media; stock market; Twitter";"Schonfeld, E., Mining the thought stream (2009) TechCrunch Weblog Article; http://blog.twitter.com/2011/03/numbers.html; Leskovec, J., Adamic, L., Huberman, B., The dynamics of viral marketing (2006) Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce; Jansen, B., Zhang, M., Sobel, K., Chowdury, A., Twitter power: Tweets as electronic word of mouth (2009) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology; Jansen, B., Zhang, M., Sobel, K., Chowdury, A., Twitter power: Tweets as electronic word of mouth (2009) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology; Gruhl, D., Guha, R., Kumar, R., Novak, J., Tomkins, A., The predictive power of online chatter (2005) SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining; Joshi, M., Das, D., Gimpel, K., Smith, N.A., (2010) Movie Reviews and Revenues: An Experiment in Text Regression NAACL-HLT; Asur, S., Huberman, A., (2010) Predicting the Future with Social Media., , CoRR, abs/1003.5699; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Xiao-Jun., Z., Twitter mood predicts the stock market Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1-8), p. 2010; Leung, T., Daouk, H., Chen, A., Forecasting stock indices: A comparison of classification and level estimation models (2000) International Journal of Forecasting, 16, pp. 173-190; Jansen, B., Zhang, M., Sobel, K., Chowdury, A., Twitter power: Tweets as electronic word of mouth (2009) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology; Gruhl, D., Guha, R., Kumar, R., Novak, J., Tomkins, A., The predictive power of online chatter (2005) SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining; Joshi, M., Das, D., Gimpel, K., Smith, N.A., Movie reviews and revenues: An experiment in text regression (2010) Proceedings of NAACL-HLT; Sharda, R., Delen, D., Predicting box-office success of motion pictures with neural networks (2006) Expert Systems with Applications, 30, pp. 243-254; Asur, S., Huberman, A., Predicting the future with social media (2010) CoRR, abs/1003.5699; Pennock, D.M., Lawrence, S., Giles, C.L., Nielsen, F.A., The real power of artificial markets (2001) Science, 291, pp. 987-988; Zhang, W., Skiena, S., Improving movie gross prediction through news analysis.

Smailović J., Grčar M., Lavrač N., Žnidaršič M.;Stream-based active learning for sentiment analysis in the financial domain;2014;Information Sciences;121;Studying the relationship between public sentiment and stock prices has been the focus of several studies. This paper analyzes whether the sentiment expressed in Twitter feeds, which discuss selected companies and their products, can indicate their stock price changes. To address this problem, an active learning approach was developed and applied to sentiment analysis of tweet streams in the stock market domain. The paper first presents a static Twitter data analysis problem, explored in order to determine the best Twitter-specific text preprocessing setting for training the Support Vector Machine (SVM) sentiment classifier. In the static setting, the Granger causality test shows that sentiments in stock-related tweets can be used as indicators of stock price movements a few days in advance, where improved results were achieved by adapting the SVM classifier to categorize Twitter posts into three sentiment categories of positive, negative and neutral (instead of positive and negative only). These findings were adopted in the development of a new stream-based active learning approach to sentiment analysis, applicable in incremental learning from continuously changing financial tweet streams. To this end, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the best querying strategy for active learning of the SVM classifier adapted to sentiment analysis of financial tweet streams. The experiments in analyzing stock market sentiments of a particular company show that changes in positive sentiment probability can be used as indicators of the changes in stock closing prices. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Li X., Xie H., Chen L., Wang J., Deng X.;News impact on stock price return via sentiment analysis;2014;Knowledge-Based Systems;198;"Financial news articles are believed to have impacts on stock price return. Previous works model news pieces in bag-of-words space, which analyzes the latent relationship between word statistical patterns and stock price movements. However, news sentiment, which is an important ring on the chain of mapping from the word patterns to the price movements, is rarely touched. In this paper, we first implement a generic stock price prediction framework, and plug in six different models with different analyzing approaches. To take one step further, we use Harvard psychological dictionary and Loughran-McDonald financial sentiment dictionary to construct a sentiment space. Textual news articles are then quantitatively measured and projected onto the sentiment space. Instance labeling method is rigorously discussed and tested. We evaluate the models' prediction accuracy and empirically compare their performance at different market classification levels. Experiments are conducted on five years historical Hong Kong Stock Exchange prices and news articles. Results show that (1) at individual stock, sector and index levels, the models with sentiment analysis outperform the bag-of-words model in both validation set and independent testing set; (2) the models which use sentiment polarity cannot provide useful predictions; (3) there is a minor difference between the models using two different sentiment dictionaries. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Uhl M.W.;Reuters Sentiment and Stock Returns;2014;Journal of Behavioral Finance;33;Sentiment from more than 3.6 million Reuters news articles is tested in a vector autoregression model framework on its ability to forecast returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index. We show that Reuters sentiment can explain and predict changes in stock returns better than macroeconomic factors. We further find that negative Reuters sentiment has more predictive power than positive Reuters sentiment. Trading strategies with Reuters sentiment achieve significant outperformance with high success rates as well as high Sharpe ratios. © 2014, © The Institute of Behavioral Finance.;"Out-of-sample forecasts; Reuters sentiment; Stock returns; Vector autoregression model";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is All That Talk Just Noise?

Wu J.-L., Yu L.-C., Chang P.-C.;An intelligent stock trading system using comprehensive features;2014;Applied Soft Computing Journal;23;The aim of this study is to predict automatic trading decisions in stock markets. Comprehensive features (CF) for predicting future trend are very difficult to generate in a complex environment, especially in stock markets. According to related work, the relevant stock information can help investors formulate objects that may result in better profits. With this in mind, we present a framework of an intelligent stock trading system using comprehensive features (ISTSCF) to predict future stock trading decisions. The ISTSCF consists of stock information extraction, prediction model learning and stock trading decision. We apply three different methods to generate comprehensive features, including sentiment analysis (SA) that provides sensitive market events from stock news articles for sentiment indices (SI), technical analysis (TA) that yields effective trading rules based on trading information on the stock exchange for technical indices (TI), as well as the trend-based segmentation method (TBSM) that raises trading decisions from stock price for trading signals (TS). Experiments on the Taiwan stock market show that the results of employing comprehensive features are significantly better than traditional methods using numeric features alone (without textual sentiment features). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;"Comprehensive features; Intelligent stock trading; Sentiment analysis; Technical analysis";"Martikainen, T., Perttunen, J., Yli-Olli, P., Gunasekaran, A., The impact of the return interval on common factors in stock returns: Evidence from a thin security market (1994) J.

Song Q., Liu A., Yang S.Y.;Stock portfolio selection using learning-to-rank algorithms with news sentiment;2017;Neurocomputing;17;In this study, we apply learning-to-rank algorithms to design trading strategies using relative performance of a group of stocks based on investors’ sentiment toward these stocks. We show that learning-to-rank algorithms are effective in producing reliable rankings of the best and the worst performing stocks based on investors’ sentiment. More specifically, we use the sentiment shock and trend indicators introduced in the previous studies, and we design stock selection rules of holding long positions of the top 25% stocks and short positions of the bottom 25% stocks according to rankings produced by learning-to-rank algorithms. We then apply two learning-to-rank algorithms, ListNet and RankNet, in stock selection processes and test long-only and long-short portfolio selection strategies using 10 years of market and news sentiment data. Through backtesting of these strategies from 2006 to 2014, we demonstrate that our portfolio strategies produce risk-adjusted returns superior to the S&P 500 index return, the hedge fund industry average performance - HFRIEMN, and some sentiment-based approaches without learning-to-rank algorithm during the same period. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;"Financial news sentiment; Learning-to-rank; Long-short strategy; Stock portfolio selection; Trading strategy";"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

Shynkevich Y., McGinnity T.M., Coleman S.A., Belatreche A.;Forecasting movements of health-care stock prices based on different categories of news articles using multiple kernel learning;2016;Decision Support Systems;28;The market state changes when a new piece of information arrives. It affects decisions made by investors and is considered to be an important data source that can be used for financial forecasting. Recently information derived from news articles has become a part of financial predictive systems. The usage of news articles and their forecasting potential have been extensively researched. However, so far no attempts have been made to utilise different categories of news articles simultaneously. This paper studies how the concurrent, and appropriately weighted, usage of news articles, having different degrees of relevance to the target stock, can improve the performance of financial forecasting and support the decision-making process of investors and traders. Stock price movements are predicted using the multiple kernel learning technique which integrates information extracted from multiple news categories while separate kernels are utilised to analyse each category. News articles are partitioned according to their relevance to the target stock, its sub-industry, industry, group industry and sector. The experiments are run on stocks from the Health Care sector and show that increasing the number of relevant news categories used as data sources for financial forecasting improves the performance of the predictive system in comparison with approaches based on a lower number of categories. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Yin L., Yang Q.;Predicting the oil prices: Do technical indicators help?;2016;Energy Economics;29;This paper aims to investigate the predictability of technical indicators to directly forecast oil prices and compare their performances with macroeconomic variables. We find that technical indicators do exhibit statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power under OLS regressions and forecast combinations, clearly exceeding that of well-known macroeconomic variables and state-of-the-art oil-macro forecasting variables. Moreover, the strength of the predictive evidence is substantial during recessions and expansions and can detect the typical decline in the oil returns near business-cycle peaks effectively. Furthermore, technical indicators reveal substantial economic value for investors, in terms of superior oil risk premium forecasts and sizable utility gains. The technical indicators' ability to predict the oil price stems in part from its ability to predict changes in sentiment, suggesting the financialization of oil markets. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;"Business cycle; Macroeconomic variables; Oil price predictability; Out-of-sample forecasts; Technical indicators";"Aastveit, K.A., Oil price shocks in a data-rich environment[J] (2014) Energy Econ., 45, pp. 268-279; Aastveit, K.A., Bjørnland, H.C., Thorsrud, L.A., What drives oil prices? emerging versus developed economies[J] (2015) J.

Khadjeh Nassirtoussi A., Aghabozorgi S., Ying Wah T., Ngo D.C.L.;Text mining of news-headlines for FOREX market prediction: A Multi-layer Dimension Reduction Algorithm with semantics and sentiment;2015;Expert Systems with Applications;124;"In this paper a novel approach is proposed to predict intraday directional-movements of a currency-pair in the foreign exchange market based on the text of breaking financial news-headlines. The motivation behind this work is twofold: First, although market-prediction through text-mining is shown to be a promising area of work in the literature, the text-mining approaches utilized in it at this stage are not much beyond basic ones as it is still an emerging field. This work is an effort to put more emphasis on the text-mining methods and tackle some specific aspects thereof that are weak in previous works, namely: the problem of high dimensionality as well as the problem of ignoring sentiment and semantics in dealing with textual language. This research assumes that addressing these aspects of text-mining have an impact on the quality of the achieved results. The proposed system proves this assumption to be right. The second part of the motivation is to research a specific market, namely, the foreign exchange market, which seems not to have been researched in the previous works based on predictive text-mining. Therefore, results of this work also successfully demonstrate a predictive relationship between this specific market-type and the textual data of news. Besides the above two main components of the motivation, there are other specific aspects that make the setup of the proposed system and the conducted experiment unique, for example, the use of news article-headlines only and not news article-bodies, which enables usage of short pieces of text rather than long ones; or the use of general financial breaking news without any further filtration. In order to accomplish the above, this work produces a multi-layer algorithm that tackles each of the mentioned aspects of the text-mining problem at a designated layer. The first layer is termed the Semantic Abstraction Layer and addresses the problem of co-reference in text mining that is contributing to sparsity. Co-reference occurs when two or more words in a text corpus refer to the same concept. This work produces a custom approach by the name of Heuristic-Hypernyms Feature-Selection which creates a way to recognize words with the same parent-word to be regarded as one entity. As a result, prediction accuracy increases significantly at this layer which is attributed to appropriate noise-reduction from the feature-space. The second layer is termed Sentiment Integration Layer, which integrates sentiment analysis capability into the algorithm by proposing a sentiment weight by the name of SumScore that reflects investors' sentiment. Additionally, this layer reduces the dimensions by eliminating those that are of zero value in terms of sentiment and thereby improves prediction accuracy. The third layer encompasses a dynamic model creation algorithm, termed Synchronous Targeted Feature Reduction (STFR). It is suitable for the challenge at hand whereby the mining of a stream of text is concerned. It updates the models with the most recent information available and, more importantly, it ensures that the dimensions are reduced to the absolute minimum. The algorithm and each of its layers are extensively evaluated using real market data and news content across multiple years and have proven to be solid and superior to any other comparable solution. The proposed techniques implemented in the system, result in significantly high directional-accuracies of up to 83.33%. On top of a well-rounded multifaceted algorithm, this work contributes a much needed research framework for this context with a test-bed of data that must make future research endeavors more convenient. The produced algorithm is scalable and its modular design allows improvement in each of its layers in future research. This paper provides ample details to reproduce the entire system and the conducted experiments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
